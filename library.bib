abstract = {The magnetic moments of nuclei in normal matter will result in a nuclear paramagnetic polarization upon establishment of equilibrium in a constant magnetic field. It is shown that a radiofrequency field at right angles to the constant field causes a forced precession of the total polarization around the constant field with decreasing latitude as the Larmor frequency approaches adiabatically the frequency of the r-f field. Thus there results a component of the nuclear polarization at right angles to both the constant and the r-f field and it is shown that under normal laboratory conditions this component can induce observable voltages. In Section 3 we discuss this nuclear induction, considering the effect of external fields only, while in Section 4 those modifications are described which originate from internal fields and finite relaxation times. {\textcopyright} 1946 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Donor impurity spins in silicon-28 are highly competitive qubits for upcoming solid-state quantum technologies, yet a proven scalable strategy for multi-qubit devices remains conspicuously absent. These CMOS-compatible, atomically identical qubits offer significant advantages including 3-hour coherence ({\$}T{\_}2{\$}) lifetimes, as well as simultaneous qubit initialization, manipulation and readout fidelities near {\$}\backslashsim\backslash!99.9\backslash{\%}{\$}. These properties meet the requirements for many modern quantum error correction protocols, which are essential for constructing large-scale universal quantum technologies. However, a method of reliably coupling spatially-separated qubits, which crucially does not sacrifice qubit quality and is robust to manufacturing imperfections, has yet to be identified. Here we present such a platform for donor qubits in silicon, by exploiting optically-accessible `deep' chalcogen donors. We show that these donors emit highly uniform light, can be optically initialized, and offer long-lived spin qubit ground states without requiring milliKelvin temperatures. These combined properties make chalcogen donors uniquely suitable for incorporation into silicon photonic architectures for single-shot single-qubit readout as well as for multi-qubit coupling. This unlocks clear pathways for silicon-based quantum computing, spin to photon conversion, photonic memories, silicon-integrated triggered single photon sources and all-optical silicon switches.},

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging at the ultimate sensitivity limit of single molecules or single nuclear spins requires fundamentally new detection strategies. The strong coupling regime, when interaction between sensor and sample spins dominates all other interactions, is one such strategy. In this regime, classically forbidden detection of completely unpolarized nuclei is allowed, going beyond statistical fluctuations in magnetization. Here we realize strong coupling between an atomic (nitrogen-vacancy) sensor and sample nuclei to perform nuclear magnetic resonance on four 29 Si spins. We exploit the field gradient created by the diamond atomic sensor, in concert with compressed sensing, to realize imaging protocols, enabling individual nuclei to be located with Angstrom precision. The achieved signal-to-noise ratio under ambient conditions allows single nuclear spin sensitivity to be achieved within seconds. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {A machine learning approach is presented for analyzing complex two-dimensional hyperfine sublevel correlation electron paramagnetic resonance (HYSCORE EPR) spectra with the proficiency of an expert spectroscopist. The computer vision algorithm requires no training on experimental data; rather, all of the spin physics required to interpret the spectra are learned from simulations alone. This approach is therefore applicable even when insufficient experimental data exist to train the algorithm. The neural network is demonstrated to be capable of utilizing the full information content of two-dimensional 14 N HYSCORE spectra to predict the magnetic coupling parameters and their underlying probability distributions that were previously inaccessible. The predicted hyperfine (a, T) and 14 N quadrupole (K, $\eta$) coupling constants deviate from the previous manual analyses of the experimental spectra on average by 0.11 MHz, 0.09 MHz, 0.19 MHz, and 0.09, respectively.},

abstract = {Pulsed excitation of broad spectra requires very high field strengths if monochromatic pulses are used. If the corresponding high power is not available or not desirable, the pulses can be replaced by suitable low-power pulses that distribute the power over a wider bandwidth. As a simple case, we use microwave pulses with a linear frequency chirp. We use these pulses to excite spectra of single nitrogen-vacancy centres in a Ramsey experiment. Compared to the conventional Ramsey experiment, our approach increases the bandwidth by at least an order of magnitude. Compared to the conventional continuous wave-ODMR experiment, the chirped Ramsey experiment does not suffer from power broadening and increases the resolution by at least an order of magnitude. As an additional benefit, the chirped Ramsey spectrum contains not only 'allowed' single quantum transitions, but also 'forbidden' zero- and double quantum transitions, which can be distinguished from the single quantum transitions by phase-shifting the readout pulse with respect to the excitation pulse or by variation of the external magnetic field strength. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract = {Over the past decade we have seen an explosion of demonstrations of quantum coherence in atomic, optical and condensed matter systems. These developments have placed a new emphasis on the production of robust and optimal quantum control techniques in the presence of environmental noise. We discuss the use of dynamical decoupling as a form of open-loop quantum control capable of suppressing the effects of dephasing in quantum coherent systems. We introduce the concept of dynamical decoupling pulse-sequence construction as a filter-design problem, making connections with filter design from control theory and electrical engineering in the analysis of pulse-sequence performance for the preservation of the phase degree of freedom in a quantum superposition. A detailed mathematical description of how dephasing and its suppression can be reduced to a linear control problem is provided, and used as motivation and context for studies of the filtration properties of various dynamical decoupling sequences. Our work then takes this practical perspective in addressing both 'standard' sequences derived from nuclear magnetic resonance and novel optimized sequences developed in the context of quantum information. Additionally, we review new techniques for the numerical construction of optimized pulse sequences in this light. We show how the filter-design perspective permits concise comparisons of the relative capabilities of these sequences and reveals the physics underlying their functionality. The use of this new analytical framework allows us to derive new insights into the performance of these sequences and reveals important limiting issues, such as the effect of digital clocking on optimized sequence performance. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We outline how logical qubits are physically moved on the array, how qubit braid transformations are constructed, and how a braid between two logical qubits is equivalent to a controlled-NOT.

Moreover, QAC provides a mechanism for overcoming the precision limit of the device, in addition to correcting calibration errors. Performance is robust even to missing qubits.

abstract = {Electronic spins in semiconductors have been used extensively to explore the limits of external control over quantum mechanical phenomena. A long-standing goal of this research has been to identify or develop robust quantum systems that can be easily manipulated, for future use in advanced information and communication technologies. Recently, a point defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy centre has attracted a great deal of interest because it possesses an atomic-scale electronic spin state that can be used as an individually addressable, solid-state quantum bit (qubit), even at room temperature. These exceptional quantum properties have motivated efforts to identify similar defects in other semiconductors, as they may offer an expanded range of functionality not available to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. Notably, several defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have been suggested as good candidates for exploration, owing to a combination of computational predictions and magnetic resonance data. Here we demonstrate that several defect spin states in the 4H polytype of SiC (4H-SiC) can be optically addressed and coherently controlled in the time domain at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 kelvin. Using optical and microwave techniques similar to those used with diamond nitrogen-vacancy qubits, we study the spin-1 ground state of each of four inequivalent forms of the neutral carbon-silicon divacancy, as well as a pair of defect spin states of unidentified origin. These defects are optically active near telecommunication wavelengths, and are found in a host material for which there already exist industrial-scale crystal growth and advanced microfabrication techniques. In addition, they possess desirable spin coherence properties that are comparable to those of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. This makes them promising candidates for various photonic, spintronic and quantum information applications that merge quantum degrees of freedom with classical electronic and optical technologies.},

So far, little is known about protection against decoherence for quantum annealing, a computational paradigm aiming to exploit ground-state quantum dynamics to solve optimization problems more rapidly than is possible classically. Here we develop error correction for quantum annealing and experimentally demonstrate it using antiferromagnetic chains with up to 344 superconducting flux qubits in processors that have recently been shown to physically implement programmable quantum annealing. We demonstrate a substantial improvement over the performance of the processors in the absence of error correction.

In this condition the system can absorb energy from an applied radiofrequency 6eld. With the absorption of energy, however, the spin temperature tends to rise and the rate of absorption to decrease. Through this "satura- tion" effect, and in some cases by a more direct method, the spin-lettre relaxation time Ti can be measured. The interaction among the magnetic nuclei, with which a characteristic time Tg' is associated, contributes to the width of the absorption line. Both interactions have been studied in a variety of substances, but with the emphasis on liquids containing hydrogen. Magnetic resonance absorption is observed by means of a radiofrequenqy bridge; the magnetic field at the sample is modulated at a low frequency. A detailed analysis of the method by which T{\~{}} is derived from saturation experiments is given. Relaxation times observed range from 10 4 to 10' seconds.

Here, we propose to address this challenge using deep learning algorithms, leveraging the remarkable progress made in the field of image recognition, natural language processing, and more recently, structured data. We demonstrate a neural network based methodology that allows for extraction of the noise spectrum associated with any qubit surrounded by an arbitrary bath, with significantly greater accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The technique requires only a two-pulse echo decay curve as input data and can further be extended either for constructing customized optimal dynamical decoupling protocols or for obtaining critical qubit attributes such as its proximity to the sample surface. Our results can be applied to a wide range of qubit platforms, and provide a framework for improving qubit performance with applications not only in quantum computing and nanoscale sensing but also in material characterization techniques such as magnetic resonance.},

abstract = {The spin lifetime and diffusion length of electrons are transport parameters that define the scale of coherence in spintronic devices and circuits. As these parameters are many orders of magnitude larger in semiconductors than in metals, semiconductors could be the most suitable for spintronics. So far, spin transport has only been measured in direct-bandgap semiconductors or in combination with magnetic semiconductors, excluding a wide range of non-magnetic semiconductors with indirect bandgaps. Most notable in this group is silicon, Si, which (in addition to its market entrenchment in electronics) has long been predicted a superior semiconductor for spintronics with enhanced lifetime and transport length due to low spin-orbit scattering and lattice inversion symmetry. Despite this promise, a demonstration of coherent spin transport in Si has remained elusive, because most experiments focused on magnetoresistive devices; these methods fail because of a fundamental impedance mismatch between ferromagnetic metal and semiconductor, and measurements are obscured by other magnetoelectronic effects. Here we demonstrate conduction-band spin transport across 10 mum undoped Si in a device that operates by spin-dependent ballistic hot-electron filtering through ferromagnetic thin films for both spin injection and spin detection. As it is not based on magnetoresistance, the hot-electron spin injection and spin detection avoids impedance mismatch issues and prevents interference from parasitic effects. The clean collector current shows independent magnetic and electrical control of spin precession, and thus confirms spin coherent drift in the conduction band of silicon.},

abstract = {It has recently been shown that one can perform quantum computation in a Heisenberg chain in which the interactions are 'always on', provided that one can abruptly tune the Zeeman energies of the individual (pseudo-)spins. Here we provide a more complete analysis of this scheme, including several generalizations. We generalize the interaction to an anisotropic form (incorporating the XY, or Forster, interaction as a limit), providing a proof that a chain coupled in this fashion tends to an effective Ising chain in the limit of far off-resonant spins. We derive the primitive two-qubit gate that results from exploiting abrupt Zeeman tuning with such an interaction. We also demonstrate, via numerical simulation, that the same basic scheme functions in the case of smoothly shifted Zeeman energies. We conclude with some remarks regarding generalisations to two- and three-dimensional arrays.},

Both types of irradiation reduced S-Phi(f) at most temperatures and magnetic fields and increased J(c) at all temperatures and magnetic fields. By measuring S-Phi(f) versus temperature, we extract the distribution of vortex pinning energies, D(U-0). Both crystals have peaks in D(U-0) near 0.1 eV and 0.2 eV before irradiation, and a much reduced peak near 0.1 eV after irradiation. The noise level after either kind of irradiation was substantially higher than in an unirradiated YBCO film.},

Effectively, the interaction with the environment is reduced. In particular, a sequence of $\pi$ pulses is considered. Here we present exact results on the suppression of the coupling of a quantum bit to its environment by optimized sequences of $\pi$ pulses. The effect of various cut-offs of the spectral density of the environment is investigated. As a result we show that the harder the cut-off is, the better an optimized pulse sequence can deal with it. For cut-offs which are neither completely hard nor very soft we advocate iterated optimized sequences.},

The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

We will call such Hamiltonians, which are common in the natural world, stoquastic. An equivalent characterization of stoquastic Hamiltonians is that they have an entry-wise non-negative Gibbs density matrix for any temperature. We prove that LH-MIN for stoquastic Hamiltonians belongs to the complexity class AM -- a probabilistic version of NP with two rounds of communication between the prover and the verifier. We also show that 2-local stoquastic LH-MIN is hard for the class MA. With the additional promise of having a polynomial spectral gap, we show that stoquastic LH-MIN belongs to the class POSTBPP=BPPpath -- a generalization of BPP in which a post-selective readout is allowed. This last result also shows that any problem solved by adiabatic quantum computation using stoquastic Hamiltonians lies in PostBPP.},

Second, results are heavily dependent on the effects of analog noise on the quantum processors, which is an engineering issue that complicates the study of the underlying quantum annealing algorithm. We introduce a novel "time-to-target" metric which avoids these two issues by challenging software solvers to match the results obtained by a quantum annealer in a short amount of time. We evaluate D-Wave's latest quantum annealer, the D-Wave 2X system, on an array of problem classes and find that it performs well on several input classes relative to state of the art software solvers running single-threaded on a CPU.},

abstract = {The rapid development of spectral-imaging methods in scanning probe, electron, and optical microscopy in the last decade have given rise for large multidimensional datasets. In many cases, the reduction of hyperspectral data to the lower-dimension materials-specific parameters is based on functional fitting, where an approximate form of the fitting function is known, but the parameters of the function need to be determined. However, functional fits of noisy data realized via iterative methods, such as least-square gradient descent, often yield spurious results and are very sensitive to initial guesses. Here, we demonstrate an approach for the reduction of the hyperspectral data using a deep neural network approach. A combined deep neural network/least-square approach is shown to improve the effective signal-to-noise ratio of band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy by more than an order of magnitude, allowing characterization when very small driving signals are used or when a material's response is weak.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating a ”hardly-relaxing” system, in which many replicas with different temperatures are simultaneously simulated and a virtual process exchanging configurations of these replicas is introduced. This exchange process is expected to let the system at low temperatures escape from a local minimum. By using this algorithm the three-dimensional +/-J Ising spin glass model is studied. The ergodicity time in this method is found much smaller than that of the multi-canonical method. In particular the time correlation function almost follows an exponential decay whose relaxation time is comparable to the ergodicity time at low temperatures. It suggests that the system relaxes very rapidly through the exchange process even in the low temperature phase.},

abstract = {The dynamical decoupling (DD) method is widely adopted to preserve coherence in different quantum systems. In the case of ideal pulses, its effects on the suppression of noise can be analytically described by the mathematical form of filter function. However, in practical experiments, the unavoidable pulse errors limit the efficiency of DD. In this paper, we study the effects of imperfect pulses on DD efficiency based on quantum trajectories. By directly generating a pseudo noise sequence correlated in time, we can explore the performance of DD with different pulse errors in the typical noise environment. It shows that, for the typical 1/ f noise environment, the phase error of operational pulses severely affects the performance of noise suppression, while the detuning and intensity errors have less influence. Also, we get the thresholds of these errors for efficient DD under the given experimental conditions. Our method can be widely applied to guide practical DD experimental implementation.},

Decoherence introduced by the system's interaction with a quantum environment is shown to be washed out completely in the limit of continuous flipping and greatly suppressed provided the interval between the pulses is made comparable to the correlation time of the environment.

abstract = {The ability to detect and deal with errors when manipulating quantum systems is a fundamental requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Unlike classical bits that are subject to only digital bit-flip errors, quantum bits are susceptible to a much larger spectrum of errors, for which any complete quantum error-correcting code must account. Whilst classical bit-flip detection can be realized via a linear array of qubits, a general fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting code requires extending into a higher-dimensional lattice. Here we present a quantum error detection protocol on a two-by-two planar lattice of superconducting qubits. The protocol detects an arbitrary quantum error on an encoded two-qubit entangled state via quantum non-demolition parity measurements on another pair of error syndrome qubits. This result represents a building block towards larger lattices amenable to fault-tolerant quantum error correction architectures such as the surface code.},

abstract = {A single atom is the prototypical quantum system, and a natural candidate for a quantum bit, or qubit--the elementary unit of a quantum computer. Atoms have been successfully used to store and process quantum information in electromagnetic traps, as well as in diamond through the use of the nitrogen-vacancy-centre point defect. Solid-state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger-scale quantum processors. Coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in lithographically defined double quantum dots in both GaAs (refs 3-5) and Si (ref. 6). However, it is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent in atomic spin qubits. Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot read-out. We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, and a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time exceeding 200 µs. This time should be even longer in isotopically enriched (28)Si samples. Combined with a device architecture that is compatible with modern integrated circuit technology, the electron spin of a single phosphorus atom in silicon should be an excellent platform on which to build a scalable quantum computer.},

These sequences are tested in a model qubit system, Be+9 ions in a Penning trap.

The statistical distributions natively available on quantum processors are a superset of those available classically. Harnessing this attribute has the potential to accelerate or otherwise improve machine learning relative to purely classical performance. A key challenge toward that goal is learning to hybridize classical computing resources and traditional learning techniques with the emerging capabilities of general purpose quantum processors. Here, we demonstrate such hybridization by training a 19-qubit gate model processor to solve a clustering problem, a foundational challenge in unsupervised learning. We use the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in conjunction with a gradient-free Bayesian optimization to train the quantum machine. This quantum/classical hybrid algorithm shows robustness to realistic noise, and we find evidence that classical optimization can be used to train around both coherent and incoherent imperfections.},

Its value at 3200 oersteds and 1.25°K was ∼3×10+3 seconds and varied as 1/T for 1.3°K{\textless}T{\textless}2°K and as 1/T7 for 2.5°K{\textless}T{\textless}4.2°K. The magnetic field dependence in the 1/T region suggests a direct phonon process. In the 1/T7 region Ts was independent of the magnetic field between 3000 and 8000 oersteds. Above a concentration of 1016 P/cm3 Ts varied rapidly with donor concentration, dropping to 10-4 seconds at 3×1017 P/cm3. In this concentration dependent region Ts was independent of the magnetic field but depended on the number of acceptors present. None of the Ts mechanisms can at present be accounted for by the theories of Pines, Bardeen, and Slichter, and Abrahams. The relaxation time Tx ($\Delta$ms=±1, $\Delta$mI=∓1) was ∼30 hours at 3000 oersteds and ∼5 hours at 8000 oersteds in fair agreement with the theory of PBS.

Quantum information is stored within an array of well-separated impurity spins in a lattice. A second set of `probe' spins are mechanically separate from the data qubits and move in-and-out of their proximity. The spin dipole-dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe's total phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe's path. We introduce a protocol to balance the systematic errors due to the spins being imperfectly located during device construction. Detailed simulations show that the surface code's threshold then corresponds to misalignments that are substantial on the scale of the device, indicating that it is very robust. We conclude that this simple `orbital probe' architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid state computing, while minimising the complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems.},

In the absence of noise, current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are obtained as functions of the applied flux, dPa, SQUID inductance L, junction critical current Io, and shunt resistance R. The effects of asymmetry in L, Io, and R are discussed. I-V characteristics, flux-voltage transfer functions, and low-frequency spectral densities of the voltage noise are obtained at experimentally interesting values of the parameters in the presence of Johnson noise in the resistive shunts. The transfer functions and voltage spectral densities are used to calculate the flux and energy resolution of the SQUID operated as an open-loop, small-signal amplifier. The resolution of the SQUID with ac flux modulation is discussed. The flux resolution calculated for the SQUID of Clarke, Goubau, and Ketchen is 1.6 × 10-5{\~{}}o Hz -1/2, approximately one-half the experimental value. Optimization of the SQUID resolution is discussed: It is shown that the optimum operating condition is/3 = 2LI0/dP0{\~{}}l. Finally, some speculations are made on the ultimate performance of the tunnel junction de SQUID. When the dominant noise source is Johnson noise in the resistive shunts, the energy resolu on per m is 4k.T(LClI 2, where C is the junction capacitance, and the constraint R = ({\~{}}o/27rCI0) / has been imposed. This result implies that the energy resolution is proportional to (function area) 1/2.

Leveraging ideas from the literature on distributed computation together with the recent work on probabilistic cluster state synthesis, our model assigns to each physical system two logical qubits: the broker and the client. Groups of brokers negotiate new graph state fragments via a probabilistic optical protocol. Completed fragments are mapped from broker to clients via a simple state transition and measurement. The clients, whose role is to store the nascent graph state long term, remain entirely insulated from failures during the brokerage. We describe an implementation in terms of NV-centres in diamond, where brokers and clients are very naturally embodied as electron and nuclear spins.},

The most notable examples include quantum enhanced algorithms for principal component analysis, quantum support vector machines, and quantum Boltzmann machines. Progress has been rapid, fostered by demonstrations of midsized quantum optimizers which are predicted to soon outperform their classical counterparts.

We present a novel approach to denoise electrocardiographic signals with deep recurrent denoising neural networks. We utilize a transfer learning technique by pretraining the network using synthetic data, generated by a dynamic ECG model, and fine-tuning it with a real data. We also investigate the impact of the synthetic training data on the network performance on real signals. The proposed method was tested on a real dataset with varying amount of noise. The results indicate that four-layer deep recurrent neural network can outperform reference methods for heavily noised signal. Moreover, networks pretrained with synthetic data seem to have better results than network trained with real data only. We show that it is possible to create state-of-the art denoising neural network that, pretrained on artificial data, can perform exceptionally well on real ECG signals after proper fine-tuning.},

Here, we focus on multiplicative Gaussian amplitude control noise on a driven qubit sensor and show that sensing protocols using optimally band-limited Slepian modulation offer substantial benefit in realistic scenarios. Special emphasis is given to laying out the theoretical framework necessary for extending nonparametric multitaper spectral estimation to the quantum setting by highlighting key points of contact and differences with respect to the classical formulation. In particular, we introduce and analyze two approaches (adaptive vs single setting) to quantum multitaper estimation, and show how they provide a practical means to both identify fine spectral features not otherwise detectable by existing protocols and to obtain reliable prior estimates for use in subsequent parametric estimation, including high-resolution Bayesian techniques. We quantitatively characterize the performance of both single- and multitaper Slepian estimation protocols by numerically reconstructing representative spectral densities, and demonstrate their advantage over dynamical-decoupling noise spectroscopy approaches in reducing bias from spectral leakage as well as in compensating for aliasing effects while maintaining a desired sampling resolution.},

abstract = {A review of our present understanding about the minority carrier recombination in silicon with dopant concentration in the range of 1018-1020 cm-3 is presented. After providing a short phenomenological description of carrier recombination processes and lifetime, the main theories of carrier recombination in a semiconductor are briefly reviewed and their expected contributions to carrier recombination in silicon at heavy doping are indicated. The various methods used for measuring the minority carrier lifetime in heavily doped silicon are described and critically examined. Four different mechanisms are examined to explain the available lifetime data. Two of these involve SRH-type phononic recombination (i) via deep level traps generated by dopant introduced defects and (ii) through shallow donor/acceptor states. The other two non-phononic mechanisms are: (iii) Band to band Auger recombination and (iv) trap assisted Auger recombination. Mechanism (i) can not explain the observed insensitivity of lifetime to processing conditions and the dopant atoms, and contribution of (ii) remains insignificant up to the heaviest doping. Phonon assisted band to band Auger recombination appears to explain the measured lifetimes satisfactorily in p-type silicon. However, for n-type silicon this mechanism predicts considerably higher values of lifetime than the measured results and it is likely that mechanism (iv) (and probably (i) also) competes with this process. Calculations indicate that the rate of trap-assisted Auger recombination through the dopant generated acceptor states in p-type silicon and through donor states in n-type silicon becomes large enough to compete with the band to band Auger process at heavy doping. In n-type silicon Auger recombination through crystal defects like vacancies may also become important. Perhaps all these processes contribute to the carrier recombination at heavy doping but which of these controls the lifetime in n-type silicon is not known. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {Electronic spins in semiconductors have been used extensively to explore the limits of external control over quantum mechanical phenomena. A long-standing goal of this research has been to identify or develop robust quantum systems that can be easily manipulated, for future use in advanced information and communication technologies. Recently, a point defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy centre has attracted a great deal of interest because it possesses an atomic-scale electronic spin state that can be used as an individually addressable, solid-state quantum bit (qubit), even at room temperature. These exceptional quantum properties have motivated efforts to identify similar defects in other semiconductors, as they may offer an expanded range of functionality not available to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. Notably, several defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have been suggested as good candidates for exploration, owing to a combination of computational predictions and magnetic resonance data. Here we demonstrate that several defect spin states in the 4H polytype of SiC (4H-SiC) can be optically addressed and coherently controlled in the time domain at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 kelvin. Using optical and microwave techniques similar to those used with diamond nitrogen-vacancy qubits, we study the spin-1 ground state of each of four inequivalent forms of the neutral carbon-silicon divacancy, as well as a pair of defect spin states of unidentified origin. These defects are optically active near telecommunication wavelengths, and are found in a host material for which there already exist industrial-scale crystal growth and advanced microfabrication techniques. In addition, they possess desirable spin coherence properties that are comparable to those of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. This makes them promising candidates for various photonic, spintronic and quantum information applications that merge quantum degrees of freedom with classical electronic and optical technologies.},

The research on the NV centers has attracted enormous attention for its application to quantum sensing, encompassing the areas of not only physics and applied physics but also chemistry, biology, and life sciences. Nonetheless, its key technical aspects can be understood from the viewpoint of magnetic resonance. We focus on three facets of this ever-expanding research field, to which our viewpoint is especially relevant: microwave engineering, materials science, and magnetometry. In explaining these aspects, we provide a technical basis and up-to-date technologies for research on the NV centers.},

abstract = {Single-shot readout of qubits is required for scalable quantum computing. Nuclear spins are superb quantum memories due to their long coherence time, but are difficult to be read out in a single shot due to their weak interaction with probes. Here we demonstrate single-shot readout of a weakly coupled 13 C nuclear spin at room temperature, which is unresolvable in traditional protocols. States of the weakly coupled nuclear spin are trapped and read out projectively by sequential weak measurements, which are implemented by dynamical decoupling pulses. A nuclear spin coupled to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center with strength 330 kHz is read out in 200 ms with a fidelity of 95.5{\%}. This work provides a general protocol for single-shot readout of weakly coupled qubits at room temperature and therefore largely extends the range of physical systems for scalable quantum computing.},

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells", which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern. {\textcopyright} 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Quantum entanglement between spatially separated objects is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physics. The outcomes of independent measurements on entangled objects show correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics. As well as being of fundamental interest, entanglement is a unique resource for quantum information processing and communication. Entangled quantum bits (qubits) can be used to share private information or implement quantum logical gates. Such capabilities are particularly useful when the entangled qubits are spatially separated, providing the opportunity to create highly connected quantum networks or extend quantum cryptography to long distances. Here we report entanglement of two electron spin qubits in diamond with a spatial separation of three metres. We establish this entanglement using a robust protocol based on creation of spin–photon entanglement at each location and a subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of the photons heralds the projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state. We verify the resulting non-local quantum correlations by performing single-shot readout on the qubits in different bases. The long-distance entanglement reported here can be combined with recently achieved initialization, readout and entanglement operations on local long-lived nuclear spin registers, paving the way for deterministic long-distance teleportation, quantum repeaters and extended quantum networks.},

This review represents the first time that the key empirical and ab initio results have been extracted from the extensive NV literature and assembled into one consistent picture of the current understanding of the centre. As a result, the key unresolved issues concerning the NV centre are identified and the possible avenues for their resolution are examined. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

Unlocking this potential requires rapid quantum-state measurement, a 'quantum snapshot', which has now been achieved. Article tools   When Nic{\'{e}}phore Ni{\'{e}}pce created the first photographic images in the 1820s, each frame required eight hours of exposure. Fifty years later, technology had advanced enough for Eadweard Muybridge's famous demonstration that horses become 'airborne' in mid-stride (see Fig. 1). Photography had become a tool to investigate timescales beyond human perception. Numerous devices now depend on swift measurement, but none more so than the emerging family of quantum technologies. These use measurement not only to read out, but also to prepare and entangle quantum states to create exotic new sensors, simulators and computers. A certain kind of defect that occurs in diamond, the so-called nitrogen–vacancy (NV) centre, is endowed with exceptional physical properties, making it particularly suitable for use in such technologies. But there has been a problem: making measurements on them takes too long. Muybridge's cameras recorded successive images on a timescale that was fast when compared with the horse's motion, but until now the devices monitoring NV centres have not achieved the same. Reporting in Nature, two research teams have now demonstrated the ability to take quantum 'snapshots' in rapid succession, thus recording the full state of the NV-centre complex more rapidly than it evolves1, 2.},

An extrapolation of,the empirical relation to zero ionization energy predicted the g value of conduction-band (CB) electrons, g(CB) = 1.9995, which is slightly but definitely different from that of conduction electrons in the donor-impurity band of degenerate n-type silicon; although both g values have been tacitly accepted to be identical for nearly four decades. The prediction was directly verified by measuring the g value of CB electrons created either by thermal emission from shallow donors in phosphorus-doped silicon at T = 125 K and by above-band-gap optical excitation in high-purity p-type silicon at T = 3.5 K; the measured g value in both experiments was precisely g(CB) = 1.9995(1).

abstract = {The trapping lifetimes of conduction electrons photoexcited from shallow impurities have been measured in the liquid helium temperature range for samples of n-type silicon whose donor and compensating acceptor concentrations vary from 1013 to 1016 impurities/cm3. A steady state method was employed, in which the conduction electron lifetime tL is equal to ne$\tau$i/NoD. ne is the conduction electron concentration which is determined from low temperature photo-Hall measurements, and NOD$\tau$i is the electron generation rate. The neutral donor concentration No is measured by the Hall effect and Ti, the lifetime against photoionization of a neutral donor, is obtained directly by an electron spin resonance technique. The trapping lifetimes tL are generally independent of temperature between 4-2°K and 1–2°K, and are inversely proportional to the compensating acceptor concentration. This latter was determined using a recently developed combined infrared radiation and spin resonance method. The trapping cross-section result for phosphorus donors is about 5 × 10−12 cm2 at 3°K. This is about an order of magnitude larger than the value obtained from the giant trap theory of Lax. Also, the concentration independence of the cross-section in the region of temperature independent tL. is not easily accounted for. The mobility of electrons photoexcited with 2 micron radiation considerably exceeds the mobility of electrons photoexcited with 8–25 micron radiation. This suggests the possibility of excitation to another band or minimum by the 2 micron radiation, as is also suggested by the free carrier absorption peak near 2 microns found in n-type silicon by Spitzer and Fan.},

This difficult cryogenic requirement has presented a barrier to the widespread implementation of SQUID technology. We report here on the development of a high-Tc d.c.

abstract = {Reinforcement learning has been widely used in many problems, including quantum control of qubits. However, such problems can, at the same time, be solved by traditional, non-machine-learning methods, such as stochastic gradient descent and Krotov algorithms, and it remains unclear which one is most suitable when the control has specific constraints. In this work, we perform a comparative study on the efficacy of three reinforcement learning algorithms: tabular Q-learning, deep Q-learning, and policy gradient, as well as two non-machine-learning methods: stochastic gradient descent and Krotov algorithms, in the problem of preparing a desired quantum state. We found that overall, the deep Q-learning and policy gradient algorithms outperform others when the problem is discretized, e.g. allowing discrete values of control, and when the problem scales up. The reinforcement learning algorithms can also adaptively reduce the complexity of the control sequences, shortening the operation time and improving the fidelity. Our comparison provides insights into the suitability of reinforcement learning in quantum control problems.},

abstract = {The divacancies in SiC are a family of paramagnetic defects that show promise for quantum communication technologies due to their long-lived electron spin coherence and their optical addressability at near-telecom wavelengths. Nonetheless, a mechanism for high-fidelity spin-to-photon conversation, which is a crucial prerequisite for such technologies, has not yet been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate a high-fidelity spin-to-photon interface in isolated divacancies in epitaxial films of 3C-SiC and 4H-SiC. Our data show that divacancies in 4H-SiC have minimal undesirable spin-mixing, and that the optical linewidths in our current sample are already similar to those of recent remote entanglement demonstrations in other systems. Moreover, we find that 3C-SiC divacancies have millisecond Hahn-echo spin coherence time, which is among the longest measured in a naturally isotopic solid. The presence of defects with these properties in a commercial semiconductor that can be heteroepitaxially grown as a thin film on shows promise for future quantum networks based on SiC defects.},

Long spin decoherence times T2 have been measured in isotope-enriched silicon but come far short of the T2=2T1 limit. The effect of nuclear spins on T2 is well established. However, the effect of background electron spins from ever present residual phosphorus impurities in silicon can also produce significant decoherence. We study spin decoherence decay as a function of donor concentration, 29Si concentration, and temperature using cluster expansion techniques specifically adapted to the problem of a sparse dipolarly coupled electron spin bath.

These lead to several potential advantages for a Si:Bi donor electron spin qubit compared to the more common phosphorus donor. Previous studies on Si:Bi have been performed using natural silicon where linewidths and electron spin coherence times are limited by the presence of 29Si impurities. Here we describe electron spin resonance (ESR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies on 209Bi in isotopically pure 28Si. ESR and ENDOR linewidths, transition probabilities and coherence times are understood in terms of the spin Hamiltonian parameters showing a dependence on field and mI of the 209Bi nuclear spin. We explore various decoherence mechanisms applicable to the donor electron spin, measuring coherence times up to 700 ms at 1.7 K at X-band, comparable with 28Si:P. The coherence times we measure follow closely the calculated field-sensitivity of the transition frequency, providing a strong motivation to explore 'clock' transitions where coherence lifetimes could be further enhanced.},

In order to determine the parameter regime for optimal efficiency of the quantum annealing procedure we explore a range of values of Trotter slice number P and temperature T.

abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

abstract = {The new field of quantum error correction has developed spectacularly since its origin less than two years ago. Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10{\^{}}6 qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}, would be a formidable factoring engine. Even a smaller, less accurate quantum computer would be able to perform many useful tasks.

The first major ingredient of our scheme is the assignment of significantly different probabilities to the different polarization bases during both transmission and reception, thus reducing the fraction of discarded data. A second major ingredient of our scheme is a refined analysis of accepted data: We divide the accepted data into various subsets according to the basis employed and estimate an error rate for each subset *separately*. We then show that such a refined data analysis guarantees the security of our scheme against the most general eavesdropping strategy, thus generalizing Shor and Preskill's proof of security of BB84 to our new scheme. Up till now, most proposed proofs of security of single-particle type quantum key distribution schemes have relied heavily upon the fact that the bases are chosen uniformly, randomly and independently.

abstract = {Proposed silicon-based quantum-computer architectures have attracted attention because of their promise for scalability and their potential for synergetically utilizing the available resources associated with the existing Si technology infrastructure. Electronic and nuclear spins of shallow donors (e.g. phosphorus) in Si are ideal candidates for qubits in such proposals because of their long spin coherence times due to their limited interactions with their environments. For these spin qubits, shallow donor exchange gates are frequently invoked to perform two-qubit operations. We discuss in this review a particularly important spin decoherence channel, and bandstructure effects on the exchange gate control. Specifically, we review our work on donor electron spin spectral diffusion due to background nuclear spin flip-flops, and how isotopic purification of silicon can significantly enhance the electron spin dephasing time. We then review our calculation of donor electron exchange coupling in the presence of degenerate silicon conduction band valleys. We show that valley interference leads to orders of magnitude variations in electron exchange coupling when donor configurations are changed on an atomic scale. These studies illustrate the substantial potential that donor electron/nuclear spins in silicon have as candidates for qubits and simultaneously the considerable challenges they pose. In particular, our work on spin decoherence through spectral diffusion points to the possible importance of isotopic purification in the fabrication of scalable solid state quantum computer architectures. We also provide a critical comparison between the two main proposed spin-based solid state quantum computer architectures, namely, shallow donor bound states in Si and localized quantum dot states in GaAs. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present and characterize fiber mirrors and a miniaturized ion-trap design developed to integrate a fiber-based Fabry-Perot cavity (FFPC) with a linear Paul trap for use in cavity-QED experiments with trapped ions. Our fiber-mirror fabrication process not only enables the construction of FFPCs with small mode volumes, but also allows us to minimize the influence of the dielectric fiber mirrors on the trapped-ion pseudopotential. We discuss the effect of clipping losses for long FFPCs and the effect of angular and lateral displacements on the coupling efficiencies between cavity and fiber. Optical profilometry allows us to determine the radii of curvature and ellipticities of the fiber mirrors. From finesse measurements we infer a single-atom cooperativity of up to {\$}12{\$} for FFPCs longer than {\$}200 \backslashmu{\$}m in length; comparison to cavities constructed with reference substrate mirrors produced in the same coating run indicates that our FFPCs have similar scattering losses. We discuss experiments to anneal fiber mirrors and explore the influence of the atmosphere under which annealing occurs on coating losses, finding that annealing under vacuum increases the losses for our reference substrate mirrors. Our unique linear Paul trap design provides clearance for such a cavity and is miniaturized to shield trapped ions from the dielectric fiber mirrors. We numerically calculate the trap potential in the absence of fibers. In the experiment additional electrodes can be used to compensate distortions of the potential due to the fibers. Home-built fiber feedthroughs connect the FFPC to external optics, and an integrated nanopositioning system affords the possibility of retracting or realigning the cavity without breaking vacuum.},

Second, results are heavily dependent on the effects of analog noise on the quantum processors, which is an engineering issue that complicates the study of the underlying quantum annealing algorithm. We introduce a novel "time-to-target" metric which avoids these two issues by challenging software solvers to match the results obtained by a quantum annealer in a short amount of time.

abstract = {A computer is generally considered to be a universal computational device; i.e., it is believed able to simulate any physical computational device with a cost in computation time of at most a polynomial factor: It is not clear whether this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis},

abstract = {Next generation scalable quantum devices promise a step change in our ability to do computations. Direct quantum simulation using highly controllable quantum systems has already led to numerous insights into many body quantum physics, despite limitations in the size of the simulated system. Here we propose a hybrid simulator for the non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated infinite quantum lattices based on ideas from non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Our scheme uses a quantum coprocessor to efficiently solve a linear impurity problem with parameters iterated to self-consistency via a feedback loop evaluated on a classical computer. The required quantum resources scale linearly with the simulated time while known classical algorithms scale exponentially. Quantum gate errors can partly be accounted for in the classical feedback loop improving the simulation results. We thus conclude that current efforts to develop scalable quantum technologies have the potential to outperform classical non-equilibrium DMFT simulations in the near future.},

The calculation includes both the first-order or direct processes important at low temperatures, and the second-order or "Raman" type of term predominant in the liquid-air region. There is no difficulty in understanding the observed absence of dispersion in titanium alum at liquid-air temperatures, but, barring crystal imperfections, it is hard to understand this absence at helium temperatures unless the nearest excited states are unreasonably deep. The agreement between the orders of magnitude of the calculated and experimental relaxation times is adequate in chromium both at high and low temperatures. The calculations predict, in agreement with experiments, that at liquid-air temperatures the relaxation time should increase when a constant field H0 is applied and should be independent of the direction of H0. The computed increase, however, is apparently not great enough. At helium temperatures, $\tau$ is theoretically not quite isotropic, and d$\tau$/dH0 has the wrong sign, unless one abandons the usual formula $\rho$$\omega$∼$\omega$2 for the density of lattice oscillators. The calculations on chromium should also apply qualitatively to iron alum, discussed at the very end.},

We then demonstrate two different methods to use a DC electric field combined with an applied resonant radio-frequency (RF) field to conditionally control donor nuclear spins. The first method combines an electric-field induced conditional phase gate with standard RF pulses, and the second one simply detunes the spins off-resonance. Finally, we consider different strategies to reduce the effect of electric field inhomogeneities and obtain above 90{\%} process fidelities.},

abstract = {Effective and powerful methods for denoising real electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are important for wearable sensors and devices. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used extensively in image processing and other domains with great success but only very recently have been used in processing ECG signals. This paper presents several DL models namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) together with the more conventional filtering methods (low pass filtering, high pass filtering, Notch filtering) and the standard wavelet-based technique for denoising EEG signals. These methods are trained, tested and evaluated on different synthetic and real ECG datasets taken from the MIT PhysioNet database and for different simulation conditions (i.e. various lengths of the ECG signals, single or multiple records). The results show the CNN model is a performant model that can be used for off-line denoising ECG applications where it is satisfactory to train on a clean part of an ECG signal from an ECG record, and then to test on the same ECG signal, which would have some high level of noise added to it. However, for real-time applications or near-real time applications, this task becomes more cumbersome, as the clean part of an ECG signal is very probable to be very limited in size. Therefore the solution put forth in this work is to train a CNN model on 1 second ECG noisy artificial multiple heartbeat data (i.e. ECG at effort), which was generated in a first instance based on few sequences of real signal heartbeat ECG data (i.e. ECG at rest). Afterwards it would be possible to use the trained CNN model in real life situations to denoise the ECG signal.},

Specifically, this report shows how to examine the training validation/test loss function for subtle clues of underfitting and overfitting and suggests guidelines for moving toward the optimal balance point. Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentums. Files to help replicate the results reported here are available.},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

In this paper, a novel method called EnsemLSTM is proposed by using nonlinear-learning ensemble of deep learning time series prediction based on LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory neural networks), SVRM (support vector regression machine) and EO (extremal optimization algorithm). First, in order to avert the drawback of weak generalization capability and robustness of a single deep learning approach when facing diversiform data, a cluster of LSTMs with diverse hidden layers and neurons are employed to explore and exploit the implicit information of wind speed time series. Then predictions of LSTMs are aggregated into a nonlinear-learning regression top-layer composed of SVRM and the EO is introduced to optimize the parameters of the top-layer. Lastly, the final ensemble prediction for wind speed is given by the fine-turning top-layer. The proposed EnsemLSTM is applied on two case studies data collected from a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China, to perform ten-minute ahead utmost short term wind speed forecasting and one-hour ahead short term wind speed forecasting. Statistical tests of experimental results compared with other popular prediction models demonstrated the proposed EnsemLSTM can achieve a better forecasting performance.},

abstract = {Spatial time series forecasting problems arise in a broad range of applications, such as environmental and transportation problems. These problems are challenging because of the existence of specific spatial, short-term and long-term patterns, and the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network framework for large-scale spatial time series forecasting problems. We explicitly designed the neural network architecture for capturing various types of patterns. In preprocessing, a time series decomposition method is applied to separately feed short-term, long-term and spatial patterns into different components of a neural network. A fuzzy clustering method finds cluster of neighboring time series based on similarity of time series residuals; as they can be meaningful short-term patterns for spatial time series. In neural network architecture, each kernel of a multi-kernel convolution layer is applied to a cluster of time series to extract short-term features in neighboring areas. The output of convolution layer is concatenated by trends and followed by convolution-LSTM layer to capture long-term patterns in larger regional areas. To make a robust prediction when faced with missing data, an unsupervised pretrained denoising autoencoder reconstructs the output of the model in a fine-tuning step. The experimental results illustrate the model outperforms baseline and state of the art models in a traffic flow prediction dataset.},

abstract = {Under natural viewing conditions, small movements of the eye, head and body prevent the maintenance of a steady direction of gaze. It is known that stimuli tend to fade when they are stabilized on the retina for several seconds. However, it is unclear whether the physiological motion of the retinal image serves a visual purpose during the brief periods of natural visual fixation. This study examines the impact of fixational instability on the statistics of the visual input to the retina and on the structure of neural activity in the early visual system. We show that fixational instability introduces a component in the retinal input signals that, in the presence of natural images, lacks spatial correlations. This component strongly influences neural activity in a model of the LGN. It decorrelates cell responses even if the contrast sensitivity functions of simulated cells are not perfectly tuned to counter-balance the power-law spectrum of natural images. A decorrelation of neural activity at the early stages of the visual system has been proposed to be beneficial for discarding statistical redundancies in the input signals. The results of this study suggest that fixational instability might contribute to the establishment of efficient representations of natural stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {We calculate the electronic wave function for a phosphorus donor in silicon by numerical diagonalization of the donor Hamiltonian in the basis of the pure crystal Bloch functions. The Hamiltonian is calculated at discrete points localized around the conduction band minima in the reciprocal lattice space. Such a technique goes beyond the approximations inherent in the effective-mass theory, and can be modified to include the effects of altered donor impurity potentials and externally applied electrostatic potentials, as well as the effects of lattice strain. Modification of the donor impurity potential allows the experimentally known low-lying energy spectrum to be reproduced with good agreement, as well as the calculation of the donor wave function, which can then be used to calculate parameters important to quantum computing applications.},

abstract = {A theory of the ‘bottleneck‘ which restricts relaxation by the Orbach mechanism when too few phonons of the appropriate frequencies are available is developed for the case of a spin doublet relaxing via a single excited level. The extent to which the relaxation disturbs the distribution of phonons is found on the assumption that the only broadehing of the two bands of lattice modes concerned is that associated with the finite lifetime of the excited spin level. The relaxation is hindered most when the splitting of the doublet in an applied magnetic field His such that the bands are well separated. Otherwise overlap between them reduces the effect of the bottleneck, so that it disappears as H approaches zero. It is predicted that in certain conditions there will be a range of H and of paramagnetic concentration c in which the relaxation time is proportional to H{\^{}}1/2c{\^{}}1/4. A comparison with the few experimental data at present available provides some support for the theory. It is noteworthy that the magnitudes of the observed relaxation times are consistent with phonon lifetimes of the order of 10{\^{}}-6 s and limited by escape through the crystal surface.},

abstract = {A scalable quantum computer could be built by networking together many simple processor cells, thus avoiding the need to create a single complex structure. The difficulty is that realistic quantum links are very error prone. A solution is for cells to repeatedly communicate with each other and so purify any imperfections; however prior studies suggest that the cells themselves must then have prohibitively low internal error rates. Here we describe a method by which even error-prone cells can perform purification: groups of cells generate shared resource states, which then enable stabilization of topologically encoded data. Given a realistically noisy network (≥10{\%} error rate) we find that our protocol can succeed provided that intra-cell error rates for initialisation, state manipulation and measurement are below 0.82{\%}. This level of fidelity is already achievable in several laboratory systems.},

In this work we developed a novel method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast time series data. This approach works by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series data. Moreover, it is a generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data, as well as time series embeddings. Using influenza-like illness (ILI) forecasting as a case study, we show that the forecasting results produced by our approach are favorably comparable to the state-of-the-art.},

The negatively charged state NV- is often favored for its better spin-optical properties, whereas the presence of the neutral charge state NV0 is often minimized or neglected by using a single optimized excitation wavelength. In many cases, the use of additional laser wavelengths has an important impact on the NV optical properties and can lead to a dramatically quenched fluorescence. Through measurements of the photophysics of the NV center we show in this work that this quenching mechanism is mediated by charge state interconversion providing additional channels for nonradiative decay. Our results show that this mechanism is also sensitive to the spin state of the NV-. A better understanding of this physical mechanism will help mitigate the spin and charge state depolarization effects that are detrimental for quantum technology applications.},

abstract = {Given the effectiveness of semiconductor devices for classical computation one is naturally led to consider semiconductor systems for solid state quantum information processing. Semiconductors are particularly suitable where local control of electric fields and charge transport are required. Conventional semiconductor electronics is built upon these capabilities and has demonstrated scaling to large complicated arrays of interconnected devices. However, the requirements for a quantum computer are very different from those for classical computation, and it is not immediately obvious how best to build one in a semiconductor. One possible approach is to use spins as qubits: of nuclei, of electrons, or both in combination. Long qubit coherence times are a prerequisite for quantum computing, and in this paper we will discuss measurements of spin coherence in silicon. The results are encouraging - both electrons bound to donors and the donor nuclei exhibit low decoherence under the right circumstances. Doped silicon thus appears to pass the first test on the road to a quantum computer.},

Many of the multiobjective test problems employed in the EA literature have not been rigorously analyzed, which makes it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms tested on them. In this paper, we systematically review and analyze many problems from the EA literature, each belonging to the important class of real-valued, unconstrained, multiobjective test problems. To support this, we first introduce a set of test problem criteria, which are in turn supported by a set of definitions. Our analysis of test problems highlights a number of areas requiring attention. Not only are many test problems poorly constructed but also the important class of nonseparable problems, particularly nonseparable multimodal problems, is poorly represented. Motivated by these findings, we present a flexible toolkit for constructing well-designed test problems. We also present empirical results demonstrating how the toolkit can be used to test an optimizer in ways that existing test suites do not},

One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t){\^{}}c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.},

With this configuration we have demonstrated coherence lengths of the order of millimeters or centimeters in Nb, V, Ta, Sn, Pb, and Nb0.85 Zr0.15, in rings where the enclosed area was as large as 1 cm2, so that the periodicity in applied field was of the order of 10-7 G.

Here we demonstrate that signal intensity in a pulsed Davies ENDOR experiment depends strongly on the nuclear relaxation time T(1n), and can be severely reduced for long T(1n). We suggest a development of the original Davies ENDOR sequence that overcomes this limitation, thus offering dramatically enhanced signal intensity and spectral resolution.

abstract = {The detection of ensembles of spins under ambient conditions has revolutionized the biological, chemical, and physical sciences through magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Pushing sensing capabilities to the individual-spin level would enable unprecedented applications such as single molecule structural imaging; however, the weak magnetic fields from single spins are undetectable by conventional far-field resonance techniques. In recent years, there has been a considerable effort to develop nanoscale scanning magnetometers, which are able to measure fewer spins by bringing the sensor in close proximity to its target. The most sensitive of these magnetometers generally require low temperatures for operation, but measuring under ambient conditions (standard temperature and pressure) is critical for many imaging applications, particularly in biological systems. Here we demonstrate detection and nanoscale imaging of the magnetic field from a single electron spin under ambient conditions using a scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometer. Real-space, quantitative magnetic-field images are obtained by deterministically scanning our NV magnetometer 50 nanometers above a target electron spin, while measuring the local magnetic field using dynamically decoupled magnetometry protocols. This single-spin detection capability could enable single-spin magnetic resonance imaging of electron spins on the nano- and atomic scales and opens the door for unique applications such as mechanical quantum state transfer.},

abstract = {Neutrally charged divacancies in silicon carbide (SiC) are paramagnetic color centers whose long coherence times and near-telecom operating wavelengths make them promising for scalable quantum communication technologies compatible with existing fiber optic networks. However, local strain inhomogeneity can randomly perturb their optical transition frequencies, which degrades the indistinguishability of photons emitted from separate defects and hinders their coupling to optical cavities. Here, we show that electric fields can be used to tune the optical transition frequencies of single neutral divacancy defects in 4H-SiC over a range of several GHz via the DC Stark effect. The same technique can also control the charge state of the defect on microsecond timescales, which we use to stabilize unstable or non-neutral divacancies into their neutral charge state. Using fluorescence-based charge state detection, we show that both 975 nm and 1130 nm excitation can prepare their neutral charge state with near unity...},

abstract = {Entanglement is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum mechanics 1–3 , and is the key resource for quantum information processing 4,5 (QIP). Bipartite entangled states of identical particles have been generated and studied in several experiments, and post-selected or heralded entangled states involving pairs of photons, single photons and single atoms, or different nuclei in the solid state, have also been produced 6–12 . Here we use a deterministic quantum logic gate to generate a 'hybrid' entangled state of two trapped-ion qubits held in different isotopes of calcium, perform full tomography of the state produced, and make a test of Bell's inequality with non-identical atoms. We use a laser-driven two-qubit gate 13 , whose mechanism is insensitive to the qubits' energy splittings, to produce a maximally entangled state of one 40 Ca + qubit and one 43 Ca + qubit, held 3.5 micrometres apart in the same ion trap, with 99.8 ± 0.6 per cent fidelity. We test the CHSH (Clauser– Horne–Shimony–Holt) 14 version of Bell's inequality for this novel entangled state and find that it is violated by 15 standard deviations; in this test, we close the detection loophole 8 but not the locality loophole 7 . Mixed-species quantum logic is a powerful technique for the construction of a quantum computer based on trapped ions, as it allows protection of memory qubits while other qubits undergo logic operations or are used as photonic interfaces to other processing units 15,16 . The entangling gate mechanism used here can also be applied to qubits stored in different atomic elements; this would allow both memory and logic gate errors caused by photon scattering to be reduced below the levels required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, which is an essential prerequisite for general-purpose quantum computing. For Schr{\"{o}}dinger, entanglement was " the characteristic trait of quan-tum mechanics " 1},

abstract = {A prerequisite for exploiting spins for quantum data storage and processing is long spin coherence times. Phosphorus dopants in silicon (Si:P) have been favoured as hosts for such spins because of measured electron spin coherence times (T2) longer than any other electron spin in the solid state: 14 ms at 7 K with isotopically purified silicon. Heavier impurities such as bismuth in silicon (Si:Bi) could be used in conjunction with Si:P for quantum information proposals that require two separately addressable spin species. However, the question of whether the incorporation of the much less soluble Bi into Si leads to defect species that destroy coherence has not been addressed. Here we show that schemes involving Si:Bi are indeed feasible as the electron spin coherence time T2 is at least as long as for Si:P with non-isotopically purified silicon. We polarized the Si:Bi electrons and hyperpolarized the I=9/2 nuclear spin of (209)Bi, manipulating both with pulsed magnetic resonance. The larger nuclear spin means that a Si:Bi dopant provides a 20-dimensional Hilbert space rather than the four-dimensional Hilbert space of an I=1/2 Si:P dopant.},

Quantum fluctuations cause transitions between states and thus play the same role as thermal fluctuations in the conventional approach.

The goal is to find the ground state of the diagonal part of the Hamiltonian with high accuracy as quickly as possible. We have solved the time-dependent Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation numerically for small size systems with various exchange interactions. Comparison with the results of the corresponding classical (thermal) method reveals that the quantum annealing leads to the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use the same annealing schedule.},

Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10{\^{}}6 qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}, would be a formidable factoring engine. Even a smaller, less accurate quantum computer would be able to perform many useful tasks.

abstract = {Spintronics, or spin electronics, involves the study of active control and manipulation of spin degrees of freedom in solid-state systems. This article reviews the current status of this subject, including both recent advances and well-established results. The primary focus is on the basic physical principles underlying the generation of carrier spin polarization, spin dynamics, and spin-polarized transport in semiconductors and metals. Spin transport differs from charge transport in that spin is a nonconserved quantity in solids due to spin-orbit and hyperfine coupling. The authors discuss in detail spin decoherence mechanisms in metals and semiconductors. Various theories of spin injection and spin-polarized transport are applied to hybrid structures relevant to spin-based devices and fundamental studies of materials properties. Experimental work is reviewed with the emphasis on projected applications, in which external electric and magnetic fields and illumination by light will be used to control spin and charge dynamics to create new functionalities not feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

Here we show that loss-tolerant entanglement purification makes quantum computing feasible with the noisy and lossy links that are realistic today: With a modestly complex cell design, and using a surface code protocol with a network noise threshold of 13.3{\%}, we find that interlinks which attempt entanglement at a rate of 2MHz but suffer 98{\%} photon loss can result in kilohertz computer clock speeds (i.e. rate of high fidelity stabilizer measurements). Improved links would dramatically increase the clock speed. Our simulations employed local gates of a fidelity already achieved in ion trap devices.},

The experiments were performed at 1.25K and 9000 Mc/sec on silicon samples subjected to strains up to 10-3. From the reduction in the hyperfine splitting and the observed g anisotropy under strain the following results were deduced: For a deformation potential of 11 ev, the valley-orbit splitting (i.e., singlet-doublet spacing) for phosphorus was found to be 0.015 ev, for arsenic 0.023 ev, and for antimony 0.013 ev. For the difference in g values with H parallel (gII) and H perpendicular (g) to the valley axis we obtained for phosphorus-doped silicon, gII-g=(1.040.04)10-3.The observed g shifts with strains along different crystallographic directions revealed the presence of two distinct spin-lattice relaxation (Ts) mechanisms. These were verified and compared with the theory of Roth and Hasegawa. The effect of applied strains on the mutual electron-nuclear spin flip rate (Tx) has been demonstrated. The importance of strain experiments in unravelling relaxation mechanisms is discussed.},

In this concentration dependent region T. was independent of the mag- netic field but depended on the number of acceptors present. None of the T, mechanisms can at present be accounted for by the theories of Pines, Bardeen, and Slichter, and Abrahams. The relaxation time T, (rim. ={\&}1,nmr={\&}l) was 30 hours at 3000 oersteds and 5 hours at 8000 oersteds in fair agreement with the theory of PBS.The relaxation time Tz (d znl =+1,Am, =0) at 1.25'K exceeded 10 hours.

The bottleneck in the T„-spin exchange mechanism sug- gested by PBS is the spin-lattice relaxation time of the free carriers. This bottleneck is absent in a double spin exchange mechanism suggested by Anderson and is responsible for the observed T„process. A resonant spin-spin interaction was observed between the electron bound to an iron impurity and the phosphorus donor electron when the magnetic Geld at which the two resonance lines overlap was traversed. The application of this "mixing" eRect to a nuclear polarization scheme is discussed. A complete mixing of two levels was also observed in phosphorus doped silicon at a magnetic field of 40 oersteds. A spin diRusion process capable of transmitting a spin excitation to diRerent parts of the resonance line was observed in arsenic doped silicon.

abstract = {In recent years, surface codes have become a leading method for quantum error correction in theoretical large scale computational and communications architecture designs. Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and their natural 2-dimensional nearest neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an obvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems. While fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants, two of which are the planar- and defect- based codes. Planar codes require fewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are restricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between encoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the inherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique enabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations, maintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique comprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform universal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing the need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the overall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further reduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how lattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct (and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT between two distance 3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half of that required in any other known construction in 2D.},

Here we use a scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer to image a magnetic vortex, which is one of the most iconic objects of nanomagnetism, owing to the small size ({\~{}}10 nm) of the vortex core. We report three-dimensional, vectorial and quantitative measurements of the stray magnetic field emitted by a vortex in a ferromagnetic square dot, including the detection of the vortex core.

abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond has potential applications in nanoscale electric and magnetic-field sensing, single-photon microscopy, quantum information processing and bioimaging. These applications rely on the ability to position a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within a few nanometres of a sample, and then scan it across the sample surface, while preserving the centre's spin coherence and readout fidelity. However, existing scanning techniques, which use a single diamond nanocrystal grafted onto the tip of a scanning probe microscope, suffer from short spin coherence times due to poor crystal quality, and from inefficient far-field collection of the fluorescence from the nitrogen-vacancy centre. Here, we demonstrate a robust method for scanning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within tens of nanometres from a sample surface that addresses both of these concerns. This is achieved by positioning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre at the end of a high-purity diamond nanopillar, which we use as the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our approach ensures long nitrogen-vacancy spin coherence times (∼75 µs), enhanced nitrogen-vacancy collection efficiencies due to waveguiding, and mechanical robustness of the device (several weeks of scanning time). We are able to image magnetic domains with widths of 25 nm, and demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of 56 nT Hz(-1/2) at a frequency of 33 kHz, which is unprecedented for scanning nitrogen-vacancy centres.},

A quantum annealer, in particular, solves optimization problems by evolving a known initial configuration at non-zero temperature towards the ground state of a Hamiltonian encoding a given problem. Here, we present results from tests on a 108 qubit D-Wave One device based on superconducting flux qubits. By studying correlations we find that the device performance is inconsistent with classical annealing or that it is governed by classical spin dynamics. In contrast, we find that the device correlates well with simulated quantum annealing. We find further evidence for quantum annealing in the form of small-gap avoided level crossings characterizing the hard problems. To assess the computational power of the device we compare it against optimized classical algorithms.},

Photonic channels appear to be very attractive for the physical implementation of quantum communication. However, owing to losses and decoherence in the channel, the communication fidelity decreases exponentially with the channel length. Here we describe a scheme that allows the implementation of robust quantum communication over long lossy channels. The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic ensembles, beam splitters, and single-photon detectors with moderate efficiencies, and is therefore compatible with current experimental technology. We show that the communication efficiency scales polynomially with the channel length, and hence the scheme should be operable over very long distances.},

We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems.

Accuracy and reliability of neural network outputs from real experimental data were found to be unexpectedly high. The networks are also able to reject exchange interactions and to return a measure of uncertainty in the resulting distance distributions. This paper describes the design of the training databases, discusses the training process, and rationalizes the observed performance. Neural networks produced in this work are incorporated as options into Spinach and DeerAnalysis packages.},

abstract = {Donors in silicon are now demonstrated as one of the leading candidates for implementing qubits and quantum information processing. Single qubit operations, measurements and long coherence times are firmly established, but progress on controlling two qubit interactions has been slower. One reason for this is that the inter donor exchange coupling has been predicted to oscillate with separation, making it hard to estimate in device designs. We present a multi-valley effective mass theory of a donor pair in silicon, including both a central cell potential and the effective mass anisotropy intrinsic in the Si conduction band. We are able to accurately describe the single donor properties of valley-orbit coupling and the spatial extent of donor wave functions, leading to hyperfine interaction values in close agreement with experiment. Ours is a simple framework that can be applied flexibly to a range of experimental scenarios, but it is nonetheless able to provide fast and reliable predictions. We use it to estimate the exchange coupling between two donor electrons and we find a smoothing of its expected oscillations, and predict a monotonic dependence on separation if two donors are spaced precisely along the [100] direction.},

abstract = {The performance of a D-Wave Vesuvius quantum annealer was recently compared to a suite of classical algorithms on a class of constraint satisfaction instances based on frustrated loops. However, the construction of these instances leads the maximum coupling strength to increase with problem size. As a result, larger instances are subject to amplified analog control error, and are effectively annealed at higher temperatures in both hardware and software. We generate similar constraint satisfaction instances with limited range of coupling strength and perform a similar comparison to classical algorithms. On these instances the D-Wave Vesuvius processor, run with a fixed 20{\$}\backslashmu{\$}s anneal time, shows a scaling advantage over the software solvers for the hardest regime studied. This scaling advantage opens the possibility of quantum speedup on these problems. Our results support the hypothesis that performance of D-Wave Vesuvius processors is heavily influenced by analog control error, which can be reduced and mitigated as the technology matures.},

In particular, we find that the XY family of sequences can generate signals at the 2fac, 4fac, and 8fac harmonics and their odd subharmonics, where fac is the ac signal frequency.

abstract = {Long coherence times are key to the performance of quantum bits (qubits). Here, we experimentally and theoretically show that the Hahn-echo coherence time (T2) of electron spins associated with divacancy defects in 4H-SiC reaches 1.3 ms, one of the longest T2 times of an electron spin in a naturally isotopic crystal. Using a first-principles microscopic quantum-bath model, we find that two factors determine the unusually robust coherence. First, in the presence of moderate magnetic fields (300 G and above), the 29Si and 13C paramagnetic nuclear spin baths are decoupled. In addition, because SiC is a binary crystal, homo-nuclear spin pairs are both diluted and forbidden from forming strongly coupled, nearest-neighbor spin pairs. Longer neighbor distances result in fewer nuclear spin flip-flops, a less fluctuating intra-crystalline magnetic environment, and thus a longer T2 time. Our results point to polyatomic crystals as promising hosts for coherent qubits in the solid state.},

abstract = {Non-uniform and sparse sampling of multi-dimensional NMR spectra has over the last decade become an important tool to allow for fast acquisition of multi-dimensional NMR spectra with high resolution. The success of non-uniform sampling NMR hinge on both the development of algorithms to accurately reconstruct the sparsely sampled spectra and the design of sampling schedules that maximise the information contained in the sampled data. Traditionally, the reconstruction tools and algorithms have aimed at reconstructing the full spectrum and thus ‘fill out the missing points' in the time-domain spectrum, although other techniques are based on multi-dimensional decomposition and extraction of multi-dimensional shapes. Also over the last decade, machine learning, deep neural networks, and artificial intelligence have seen new applications in an enormous range of sciences, including analysis of MRI spectra. As a proof-of-principle, it is shown here that simple deep neural networks can be trained to reconstruct sparsely sampled NMR spectra. For the reconstruction of two-dimensional NMR spectra, reconstruction using a deep neural network performs as well, if not better than, the currently and widely used techniques. It is therefore anticipated that deep neural networks provide a very valuable tool for the reconstruction of sparsely sampled NMR spectra in the future to come.},

abstract = {A spin-Hamiltonian approach to the theory of spin-lattice relaxation in paramagnetic salts is developed in which the orbit-lattice interaction is treated as a perturbation connecting states of the overall spin-Hamiltonian. The approach is much simpler than previous treatments where the spin-orbit and Zeeman effects were treated as perturbations. and is appliciable to a wide range of salts including both the iron group and the rare earth group. It is found that, for Kramers salts (ions with an odd number of electrons), many previous results apply quite generally, regardless of the relative size of the spin-orbit and crystalline field terms, buut there are important exceptations. For the case of large crystalline field splitting, the relaxation rate (inverse of the relaxation time T1) varsus as H{\^{}}4T and T{\^{}}9 for direct and Raman process respectively, as van Vleck has previously shown. The so-called Van Vleck cancellation leading to these dependence is dirived in a very simple and quite general manner. For small crystal field splittings $\Delta$, less than, or of the order of, the lattice Debye temperature, the relaxation rate varies as H-4T and aexp(-$\Delta$/kT)+bT{\^{}}9 for direct and Raman processes prspectively. The two coefficients a and b are such that the T{\^{}}9 term is important only at low temperatures where the exponential term is quite small.

Our work generalizes an approach introduced in Boixo et al. [Nat.

Our findings rule out all classical models proposed to date for the device and provide evidence that an open system quantum dynamical description of the device that starts from a quantized energy level structure is well justified, even in the presence of relevant thermal excitations and a small value of the ratio of the single-qubit decoherence time to the annealing time.},

abstract = {Any quantum system, such as those used in quantum information or magnetic resonance, is subject to random phase errors that can dramatically affect the fidelity of a desired quantum operation or measurement. In the context of quantum information, quantum error correction techniques have been developed to correct these errors, but resource requirements are extraordinary. The realization of a physically tractable quantum information system will therefore be facilitated if qubit (quantum bit) error rates are far below the so-called fault-tolerance error threshold, predicted to be of the order of 10 -3 -10 -6. The need to realize such low error rates motivates a search for alternative strategies to suppress dephasing in quantum systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate massive suppression of qubit error rates by the application of optimized dynamical decoupling pulse sequences, using a model quantum system capable of simulating a variety of qubit technologies. We demonstrate an analytically derived pulse sequence, UDD, and find novel sequences through active, real-time experimental feedback. The latter sequences are tailored to maximize error suppression without the need for a priori knowledge of the ambient noise environment, and are capable of suppressing errors by orders of magnitude compared to other existing sequences (including the benchmark multi-pulse spin echo). Our work includes the extension of a treatment to predict qubit decoherence under realistic conditions, yielding strong agreement between experimental data and theory for arbitrary pulse sequences incorporating nonidealized control pulses. These results demonstrate the robustness of qubit memory error suppression through dynamical decoupling techniques across a variety of qubit technologies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

First, we implement a time-division multiplexed approach, interleaving measurement periods with periods of unsupervised but stabilised operation during which qubits are available, for example, in quantum information experiments. Second, we employ predictive feedback during sequential but time delayed measurements to reduce the Dick effect as encountered in passive frequency standards. Both experiments demonstrate significant improvements in qubit-phase stability over 'traditional' measurement-based feedback approaches by exploiting time domain correlations in the noise processes.

These gates cause decoherence of the fragile quantum states that are central to the computer's operation. The goal of so-called 'fault-tolerant quantum computing' is therefore to compute accurately even when the error probability per gate (EPG) is high. Here we report a simple architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing, providing evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible for EPGs as high as three per cent. Such EPGs have been experimentally demonstrated, but to avoid excessive resource overheads required by the necessary architecture, lower EPGs are needed. Assuming the availability of quantum resources comparable to the digital resources available in today's computers, we show that non-trivial quantum computations at EPGs of as high as one per cent could be implemented.},

These results shed new light on the mechanisms responsible for surface noise affecting shallow spins at semiconductor interfaces, and suggests possible directions for further studies.

abstract = {Understanding the physical origin of noise affecting quantum systems is important for nearly every quantum application. Quantum-noise spectroscopy has been used in various quantum systems, such as superconducting qubits, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and trapped ions. Traditional spectroscopy methods are usually efficient in measuring noise spectra with mostly monotonically decaying contributions. However, there are important scenarios in which the noise spectrum is broadband and nonmonotonous, thus posing a challenge to existing noise-spectroscopy schemes. Here we compare several methods for noise spectroscopy: spectral decomposition based on the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence, the recently presented dynamic sensitivity control (DYSCO) sequence, and a modified DYSCO sequence with a Gaussian envelope (gDYSCO). The performance of the sequences is quantified by analytic and numeric determination of the frequency resolution, bandwidth, and sensitivity, revealing a supremacy of gDYSCO to reconstruct nontrivial features. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond coupled to a high-density C13-nuclear-spin environment, we experimentally confirm our findings. The combination of the schemes presented offers potential to record high-quality noise spectra as a prerequisite to generate quantum systems unlimited by their spin-bath environment.},

abstract = {For more than 80 years, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum theory have stimulated debate about the nature of reality. In his seminal work, John Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local realist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an inequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to quantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades, numerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because of experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in loopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of high-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin readout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use of fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions. We perform 245 trials testing the CHSH-Bell inequality {\$}S \backslashleq 2{\$} and find {\$}S = 2.42 \backslashpm 0.20{\$}. A null hypothesis test yields a probability of {\$}p = 0.039{\$} that a local-realist model for space-like separated sites produces data with a violation at least as large as observed, even when allowing for memory in the devices. This result rules out large classes of local realist theories, and paves the way for implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication and randomness certification.},

abstract = {Electrical detection of spins is an essential tool in understanding the dynamics of spins in semiconductor devices, providing valuable insights for applications ranging from optoelectronics and spintronics to quantum information processing. For electron spins bound to shallow donors in silicon, bulk electrically-detected magnetic resonance has relied on coupling to spin readout partners such as paramagnetic defects or conduction electrons which fundamentally limits spin coherence times. Here we demonstrate electrical detection of phosphorus donor electron spin resonance by transport through a silicon device, using optically-driven donor-bound exciton transitions. We use this method to measure electron spin Rabi oscillations, and, by avoiding use of an ancillary spin for readout, we are able to obtain long intrinsic electron spin coherence times, limited only by the donor concentration. We go on to experimentally address critical issues for adopting this scheme for single spin measurement in silicon nanodevices, including the effects of strain, electric fields, and non-resonant excitation. This lays the foundations for realising a versatile readout method for single spin readout with relaxed magnetic field and temperature requirements compared with spin-dependent tunneling.},

The quadratic and cubic dependence of the integrated fluorescence intensity as a function of excitation power indicate a two-photon excitation pathway for the NV- charge state and a three-photon process involved for the neutral NV0 charge state respectively. Comparing the total multi-photon energy with its single-photon equivalent, the PLE spectra follows the absorption spectrum of single photon excitation. We also observed that the efficiency of photoluminescence for different charge states, as well as the decay time constant, was dependent on the excitation wavelength and power.},

abstract = {The detection of ensembles of spins under ambient conditions has revolutionized the biological, chemical and physical sciences through magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Pushing sensing capabilities to the individual-spin level would enable unprecedented applications such as single-molecule structural imaging; however, the weak magnetic fields from single spins are undetectable by conventional far-field resonance techniques. In recent years, there has been a considerable effort to develop nanoscale scanning magnetometers, which are able to measure fewer spins by bringing the sensor in close proximity to its target. The most sensitive of these magnetometers generally require low temperatures for operation, but the ability to measure under ambient conditions (standard temperature and pressure) is critical for many imaging applications, particularly in biological systems. Here we demonstrate detection and nanoscale imaging of the magnetic field from an initialized single electron spin under ambient conditions using a scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer. Real-space, quantitative magnetic-field images are obtained by deterministically scanning our nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer 50 nm above a target electron spin, while measuring the local magnetic field using dynamically decoupled magnetometry protocols. We discuss how this single-spin detection enables the study of a variety of room-temperature phenomena in condensed-matter physics with an unprecedented combination of spatial resolution and spin sensitivity.

We prove that access to a high time resolution is key to achieving spectral reconstruction over an extended bandwidth, overcoming the limitations of existing schemes. Non-Gaussian spectroscopy is demonstrated for a classical noise model describing quadratic dephasing at an optimal point, as well as a quantum spin-boson model out of equilibrium.

Nonetheless, a mechanism for high-fidelity spin-to-photon conversation, which is a crucial prerequisite for such technologies, has not yet been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate a high-fidelity spin-to-photon interface in isolated divacancies in epitaxial films of 3C-SiC and 4H-SiC. Our data show that divacancies in 4H-SiC have minimal undesirable spin-mixing, and that the optical linewidths in our current sample are already similar to those of recent remote entanglement demonstrations in other systems. Moreover, we find that 3C-SiC divacancies have millisecond Hahn-echo spin coherence time, which is among the longest measured in a naturally isotopic solid. The presence of defects with these properties in a commercial semiconductor that can be heteroepitaxially grown as a thin film on shows promise for future quantum networks based on SiC defects.},

The qubit systems can be NV-centers in diamond, Pauli-blockade quantum dots with an excess electron or trapped ions with optical transitions, which are each placed in a cavity and subsequently entangled using a double-heralded single-photon detection scheme. The fidelity of the resulting entanglement is extremely robust against the most important errors such as detector loss, spontaneous emission, and mismatch of cavity parameters. We demonstrate how this entangling operation can be used to efficiently generate cluster states of many qubits, which, together with single qubit operations and readout, can be used to implement universal quantum computation. Existing experimental parameters indicate that high fidelity clusters can be generated with a moderate constant overhead.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPublished in: Phys. Rev.

However, the low spin number sensitivity of the technique continues to pose serious limitations. Here we demonstrate that signal intensity in a pulsed Davies ENDOR experiment depends strongly on the nuclear relaxation time T(1n), and can be severely reduced for long T(1n). We suggest a development of the original Davies ENDOR sequence that overcomes this limitation, thus offering dramatically enhanced signal intensity and spectral resolution. Finally, we observe that the sensitivity of the original Davies method to T(1n) can be exploited to measure nuclear relaxation, as we demonstrate for phosphorous donors in silicon and for endohedral fullerenes N@C(60) in CS(2).},

In some examples, we find enhancements in sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude. By visualizing the evolution of the quantum state, the mechanism exploited by the reinforcement learning method is identified as a kind of spin-squeezing strategy that is adapted to the superradiant damping.},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

Motivated by recent experiments, we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be expected. Although a better scaling is seen for QA in two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, this advantage is due to time discretization artifacts and measurements that are not possible on a physical quantum annealer. Simulations in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not show superiority.

abstract = {A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time of at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.

abstract = {A comprehensive artificial intelligence system needs to not only perceive the environment with different "senses"(e.g., seeing and hearing) but also infer the world's conditional (or even causal) relations and corresponding uncertainty. The past decade has seen major advances in many perception tasks, such as visual object recognition and speech recognition, using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. In recent years, Bayesian deep learning has emerged as a unified probabilistic framework to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models.1 In this general framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and, in turn, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, control, and so on. We also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics, such as Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

Superconducting quantum interference devices ͑SQUIDs͒ have been a key factor in the development and commercialization of ultrasensitive electric and magnetic measurement systems. In many cases, SQUID instrumentation offers the ability to make measurements where no other methodology is possible. We review the main aspects of designing, fabricating, and operating a number of SQUID measurement systems. While this article is not intended to be an exhaustive review on the principles of SQUID sensors and the underlying concepts behind the Josephson effect, a qualitative description of the operating principles of SQUID sensors and the properties of materials used to fabricate SQUID sensors is presented. The difference between low and high temperature SQUIDs and their suitability for specific applications is discussed. Although SQUID electronics have the capability to operate well above 1 MHz, most applications tend to be at lower frequencies. Specific examples of input circuits and detection coil configuration for different applications and environments, along with expected performance, are described. In particular, anticipated signal strength, magnetic field environment ͑applied field and external noise͒, and cryogenic requirements are discussed. Finally, a variety of applications with specific examples in the areas of electromagnetic, material property, nondestructive test and evaluation, and geophysical and biomedical measurements are reviewed.},

These exact solutions allow us to construct effi- cient blocked and Rao-Blackwellised MCMC algorithms. We show empirically that tree sampling is considerably more efficient than other partitioned sampling schemes and the naive Gibbs sampler, even in cases where loopy belief propagation fails to converge. We prove that tree sampling exhibits lower variance than the naive Gibbs sampler and other naive partitioning schemes using the theoretical measure of maximal correlation. We also construct new information theory tools for comparing different MCMC schemes and show that, under these, tree sampling is more efficient.},

abstract = {Quantum annealing (QA) has been proposed as a quantum enhanced optimization heuristic exploiting tunneling. Here, we demonstrate how finite range tunneling can provide considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating local minima, the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to Simulated Annealing (SA). For instances with 945 variables this results in a time-to-99$\backslash${\%}-success-probability that is {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}8{\$} times faster than SA running on a single processor core. We also compared physical QA with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical QA: D-Wave 2X runs up to {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}8{\$} times faster than an optimized implementation of QMC on a single core. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be represented on quantum hardware. For random instances of the number partitioning problem, we find numerically that QMC, as well as other algorithms designed to simulate QA, scale better than SA and better than the best known classical algorithms for this problem. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next generation quantum annealers.},

However, to uncover finer details approaching the nanoscale with greater sensitivity requires the development of a radically new sensor technology.

Although the NV center has been successfully implemented as a nanoscale scanning magnetic probe at room temperature, it has remained an outstanding challenge to extend this capability to cryogenic temperatures, where many solid-state systems exhibit non-trivial magnetic order.

abstract = {Optically linked ion traps are promising as components of network-based quantum technologies, including communication systems and modular computers. Experimental results achieved to date indicate that the fidelity of operations within each ion trap module will be far higher than the fidelity of operations involving the links; fortunately internal storage and processing can effectively upgrade the links through the process of purification. Here we perform the most detailed analysis to date on this purification task, using a protocol which is balanced to maximise fidelity while minimising the device complexity and the time cost of the process. Moreover we 'compile down' the quantum circuit to device-level operations including cooling and shutting events. We find that a linear trap with only five ions (two of one species, three of another) can support our protocol while incorporating desirable features such as global control, i.e. laser control pulses need only target an entire zone rather than differentiating one ion from its neighbour. To evaluate the capabilities of such a module we consider its use both as a universal communications node for quantum key distribution, and as the basic repeating unit of a quantum computer. For the latter case we evaluate the threshold for fault tolerant quantum computing using the surface code, finding acceptable fidelities for the 'raw' entangling link as low as 83{\%} (or under 75{\%} if an additional ion is available).},

A detailed study of many electron spin relaxation processes is carried out. It is found that for sufficiently low concentrations of P, As, and Sb impurities in silicon transient nuclear polarization should occur; for Li impurities it should not. The foregoing theoretical predictions have been verified for As by the recent experiments of Abragam and Combrisson, and of Feher.},

For the present sample, a ∼45 nm diamond crystal, NV-assisted dark-spin spectroscopy reveals the presence of nitrogen donors and a second, yet-unidentified class of paramagnetic centers. Both groups share a common spin lifetime considerably shorter than that observed for the NV spin, suggesting some form of spatial clustering, possibly on the nanoparticle surface. Using double spin resonance and dynamical decoupling, we also demonstrate control of the combined NV center-spin bath dynamics and attain NV coherence lifetimes comparable to those reported for bulk, Type Ib samples.

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an efficient and noninvasive indicator for arrhythmia detection and prevention. In real-world scenarios, ECG signals are prone to be contaminated with various noises, which may lead to wrong interpretation. Therefore, significant attention has been paid on denoising of ECG for accurate diagnosis and analysis. A denoising autoencoder (DAE) can be applied to reconstruct the clean data from its noisy version. In this paper, a DAE using the fully convolutional network (FCN) is proposed for ECG signal denoising. Meanwhile, the proposed FCN-based DAE can perform compression with regard to the DAE architecture. The proposed approach is applied to ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database and the added noise signals are obtained from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test database. The denoising performance is evaluated using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), percentage-root-mean-square difference (PRD), and improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR -textitimp ). The results of the experiments conducted on noisy ECG signals of different levels of input SNR show that the FCN acquires better performance as compared to the deep fully connected neural network- and convolutional neural network-based denoising models. Moreover, the proposed FCN-based DAE reduces the size of the input ECG signals, where the compressed data is 32 times smaller than the original. The results of the study demonstrate the superiority of FCN in denoising, with lower RMSE and PRD, as well as higher SNR -textitimp. According to the results, we believe that the proposed FCN-based DAE has a good application prospect in clinical practice.},

To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of {\$}\backslashrho{\$} and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain ``magic'' directions. If the polarization of {\$}\backslashrho{\$} along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65{\%}), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

abstract = {We argue that a quantum annealer at very long annealing times is likely to experience a quasistatic evolution, returning a final population that is close to a Boltzmann distribution of the Hamiltonian at a single (freeze-out) point during the annealing. Such a system is expected to correlate well with a proper quantum Monte Carlo simulation. It may also correlate with simulated annealing if at the freeze-out point the quantum energy eigenvalues are close to the classical ones. These correlations are just signatures of equilibration and do not mean that the evolution of the quantum annealer is classical or can be simulated by quantum Monte Carlo. The computation time extracted from such a distribution reflects the equilibrium behavior and therefore provides no information about the underlying quantum dynamics. This makes the search for quantum speedup in suboptimal quantum annealers problematic. We use an open quantum master equation with realistic parameters to illustrate quasistatic evolution in a 16 qubit quantum annealer and discuss its implication for quantum speedup.},

Setting the hyper-parameters remains a black art that requires years of experience to acquire. This report proposes several efficient ways to set the hyper-parameters that significantly reduce training time and improves performance. Specifically, this report shows how to examine the training validation/test loss function for subtle clues of underfitting and overfitting and suggests guidelines for moving toward the optimal balance point. Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentums. Files to help replicate the results reported here are available.},

Here we demonstrate an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in the spin coherence time (T₂) of nitrogen-vacancy centres compared with previous measurements: T₂≈0.6 s at 77 K. We employed dynamical decoupling pulse sequences to suppress nitrogen-vacancy spin decoherence, and found that T₂ is limited to approximately half of the longitudinal spin relaxation time over a wide range of temperatures, which we attribute to phonon-induced decoherence. Our results apply to ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy spins, and thus could advance quantum sensing, enable squeezing and many-body entanglement, and open a path to simulating driven, interaction-dominated quantum many-body Hamiltonians.},

The SQUID is current-biased at a nonzero voltage, and modulated with a 100 kHz flux. The 100 kHz voltage developed across the SQUID is amplified by a cooled, resonantLC circuit that optimally couples the SQUID impedance to the input of a room-temperature FET preamplifier. The SQUID is operated in a flux-locked loop with a dynamic range in a 1-Hz bandwidth of ±3×106. The 3-dB rolloff frequency for the loop response is typicalty 2 kHz, and the slewing rate is generally 2×104 f0 sec-1. A typical flux noise power spectrum for a SQUID at 4.2 K in a superconducting shield is presented. Above 2×10-2 Hz the spectrum is white and has an rms value of 3.5×10-5 f0 Hz-1/2. The white noise is intrinsic to the sensor and is close to the theoretical limit set by Johnson noise in the shunts. At lower frequencies, the power spectrum is approximately 10-10 (1 Hz/f) f02 Hz-1, wheref is the frequency. This value is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the calculated 1/f noise in the tunnel junctions. The factors contributing to the long-term drift of the SQUID are discussed. By regulating the temperature of the helium bath we have achieved a drift rate of 2×10-5 f0 h-1 over a 20-h period. A detailed description is given of the coupling efficiency of various input coils wound on the SQUID. The effects of coupling between the input coil, the SQUID, and the feedback (modulation) coil are described, and measurements of the coupling parameters reported. The energy resolution of the SQUID with respect to a current in a 24-turn input coil is 7×10-30 J Hz-1 for frequencies at which the flux noise has a white power spectrum. In terms of energy resolution, the SQUID has a better performance in the 1/f noise region that that of any SQUID previously reported in the literature. The long-term drift over an extended period also represents the lowest value yet reported.},

abstract = {A major challenge in using spins in the solid state for quantum technologies is protecting them from sources of decoherence. This is particularly important in nanodevices where the proximity of material interfaces, and their associated defects, can play a limiting role. Spin decoherence can be addressed to varying degrees by improving material purity or isotopic composition, for example, or active error correction methods such as dynamic decoupling (or even combinations of the two). However, a powerful method applied to trapped ions in the context of atomic clocks is the use of particular spin transitions that are inherently robust to external perturbations. Here, we show that such 'clock transitions' can be observed for electron spins in the solid state, in particular using bismuth donors in silicon. This leads to dramatic enhancements in the electron spin coherence time, exceeding seconds. We find that electron spin qubits based on clock transitions become less sensitive to the local magnetic environment, including the presence of (29)Si nuclear spins as found in natural silicon. We expect the use of such clock transitions will be of additional significance for donor spins in nanodevices, mitigating the effects of magnetic or electric field noise arising from nearby interfaces and gates.},

Here we introduce a quantum-metrology technique demonstrating precision three-dimensional electric-field measurement using a single nitrogen-vacancy defect centre spin in diamond. An a. c. electric-field sensitivity reaching 202 +/- 6 Vcm(-1) Hz(-1/2) has been achieved. This corresponds to the electric field produced by a single elementary charge located at a distance of similar to 150nm from our spin sensor with averaging for one second. The analysis of the electronic structure of the defect centre reveals how an applied magnetic field influences the electric-field-sensing properties. We also demonstrate that diamond-defect-centre spins can be switched between electric-and magnetic-field sensing modes and identify suitable parameter ranges for both detector schemes. By combining magnetic-and electric-field sensitivity, nanoscale detection and ambient operation, our study should open up new frontiers in imaging and sensing applications ranging from materials science to bioimaging.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses a number of issues related to measuring poverty over time. It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

Nevertheless, the coherence lifetimes of electron spins in the solid state have typically remained several orders of magnitude lower than that achieved in isolated high-vacuum systems such as trapped ions. Here we examine electron spin coherence of donors in pure (28)Si material (residual (29)Si concentration {\textless}50 ppm) with donor densities of 10(14)-10(15) cm(-3). We elucidate three mechanisms for spin decoherence, active at different temperatures, and extract a coherence lifetime T(2) up to 2 s. In this regime, we find the electron spin is sensitive to interactions with other donor electron spins separated by {\~{}}200 nm. A magnetic field gradient suppresses such interactions, producing an extrapolated electron spin T(2) of 10 s at 1.8 K. These coherence lifetimes are without peer in the solid state and comparable to high-vacuum qubits, making electron spins of donors in silicon ideal components of quantum computers, or quantum memories for systems such as superconducting qubits.},

abstract = {With qubit measurement and control fidelities above the threshold of fault-tolerance, much attention is moving towards the daunting task of scaling up the number of physical qubits to the large numbers needed for fault tolerant quantum computing. Here, quantum dot based spin qubits may offer significant advantages due to their potential for high densities, all-electrical operation, and integration onto an industrial platform. In this system, the initialisation, readout, single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in various qubit representations. However, as seen with other small scale quantum computer demonstrations, combining these elements leads to new challenges involving qubit crosstalk, state leakage, calibration, and control hardware which provide invaluable insight towards scaling up. Here we address these challenges and demonstrate a programmable two-qubit quantum processor in silicon by performing both the Deutsch-Josza and the Grover search algorithms. In addition, we characterise the entanglement in our processor through quantum state tomography of Bell states measuring state fidelities between 85-89{\%} and concurrences between 73-80{\%}. These results pave the way for larger scale quantum computers using spins confined to quantum dots.},

A multi-valley effective mass theory, dealing non-perturbatively with valley-orbit interactions induced by a donor-dependent central cell potential, allows us to obtain a very reliable picture of the donor wave function within a relatively simple framework. Variational optimization of the 1s donor binding energies calculated with a new trial wave function, in a pseudopotential with two fitting parameters, allows an accurate match of the experimentally determined donor energy levels, while the correct limiting behavior for the electronic density, both close to and far from each impurity nucleus, is captured by fitting the measured contact hyperfine coupling between the donor nuclear and electron spin. We go on to include an external uniform electric field in order to model Stark physics: With no extra ad hoc parameters, variational minimization of the complete donor ground energy allows a quantitative description of the field-induced reduction of electronic density at each impurity nucleus. Detailed comparisons with experimental values for the shifts of the contact hyperfine coupling reveal very close agreement for all the donors measured (P, As, Sb and Bi). Finally, we estimate field ionization thresholds for the donor ground states, thus setting upper limits to the gate manipulation times for single qubit operations in Kane-like architectures: the Si:Bi system is shown to allow for A gates as fast as around 10 MHz.},

abstract = {The network paradigm for quantum computing involves interconnecting many modules to form a scalable machine. Typically it is assumed that the links between modules are prone to noise while operations within modules have significantly higher fidelity. To optimise fault tolerance in such architectures we introduce a hierarchical generalisation of the surface code: a small `patch' of the code exists within each module, and constitutes a single effective qubit of the logic-level surface code. Errors primarily occur in a two-dimensional subspace, i.e. patch perimeters extruded over time, and the resulting noise threshold for inter-module links can exceed {\~{}} 10{\%} even in the absence of purification. Increasing the number of qubits within each module decreases the number of qubits necessary for encoding a logical qubit. But this advantage is relatively modest, and broadly speaking a `fine grained' network of small modules containing only {\~{}} 8 qubits is competitive in total qubit count versus a `course' network with modules containing many hundreds of qubits.},

Under typical conditions, the NV can have two stable charge states, negative (NV-) or neutral (NV0), with photo-induced interconversion of these two states. Here, we present detailed studies of the ionization dynamics of single NV centres in bulk diamond at room temperature during illumination and its dependence on the excitation wavelength and power. We apply a recent method which allows us to directly measure the charge state of a single NV centre, and observe its temporal evolution. We find that the steady-state NV- population is always 75{\%} for 450-610 nm excitation wavelength. In combination with saturation measurements, we show that the optimal excitation wavelength is around 510-540 nm. Furthermore, the relative absorption cross-section of NV- is determined for 540-610 nm, revealing a double-peak structure. Finally, the energy of the NV- ground state of 2.6 eV below the conduction band is measured. These results reveal new insights into the charge state dynamics of the NV centre. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract = {Practical quantum communication between remote quantum memories rely on single photons at telecom wavelengths. Although spin-photon entanglement has been demonstrated in atomic and solid-state qubit systems, the produced single photons at short wavelengths and with polarization encoding are not suitable for long-distance communication, because they suffer from high propagation loss and depolarization in optical fibres. Establishing entanglement between remote quantum nodes would further require the photons generated from separate nodes to be indistinguishable. Here, we report the observation of correlations between a quantum-dot spin and a telecom single photon across a 2-km fibre channel based on time-bin encoding and background-free frequency downconversion. The downconverted photon at telecom wavelengths exhibits two-photon interference with another photon from an independent source, achieving a mean wavepacket overlap of greater than 0.89 despite their original wavelength mismatch (900 and 911 nm). The quantum-networking operations that we demonstrate will enable practical communication between solid-state spin qubits across long distances.},

@article{Hochreiter1997,
abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

The adaptive Bayesian approach to parameter estimation allows for an efficient use of resources thanks to adaptive experiment design. For its practical success fast numerical solutions for the Bayesian update and the adaptive experiment design are crucial. Here we show that neural networks can be trained to become fast and strong experiment-design heuristics using a combination of an evolutionary strategy and reinforcement learning. Neural-network heuristics are shown to outperform established heuristics for the technologically important example of frequency estimation of a qubit that suffers from dephasing. Our method of creating neural-network heuristics is very general and complements the well-studied sequential Monte-Carlo method for Bayesian updates to form a complete framework for adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation.},

abstract = {Initialization and read-out of coupled quantum systems are essential ingredients for the implementation of quantum algorithms. Single-shot read-out of the state of a multi-quantum-bit (multi-qubit) register would allow direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement), and would give access to further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation. Although spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, their single-shot detection has been achieved only for isolated qubits. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register in a low-temperature solid-state system by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity read-out of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and use this read-out to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto, and subsequently measuring, the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control: we demonstrate initialization, coherent manipulation and single-shot read-out in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the way for a test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the implementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols.},

abstract = {Many interesting but practically intractable problems can be reduced to that of finding the ground state of a system of interacting spins; however, finding such a ground state remains computationally difficult. It is believed that the ground state of some naturally occurring spin systems can be effectively attained through a process called quantum annealing. If it could be harnessed, quantum annealing might improve on known methods for solving certain types of problem. However, physical investigation of quantum annealing has been largely confined to microscopic spins in condensed-matter systems. Here we use quantum annealing to find the ground state of an artificial Ising spin system comprising an array of eight superconducting flux quantum bits with programmable spin-spin couplings. We observe a clear signature of quantum annealing, distinguishable from classical thermal annealing through the temperature dependence of the time at which the system dynamics freezes. Our implementation can be configured in situ to realize a wide variety of different spin networks, each of which can be monitored as it moves towards a low-energy configuration. This programmable artificial spin network bridges the gap between the theoretical study of ideal isolated spin networks and the experimental investigation of bulk magnetic samples. Moreover, with an increased number of spins, such a system may provide a practical physical means to implement a quantum algorithm, possibly allowing more-effective approaches to solving certain classes of hard combinatorial optimization problems.},

@article{Shor1997,
abstract = {A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time by at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. 1. Introduction. One of the first results in the mathematics of computation, which underlies the subsequent development of much of theoretical computer science, was the distinction between computable and noncomputable functions shown in pa-pers of Church [1936], Post [1936], and Turing [1936]. The observation that several apparently different definitions of what it meant for a function to be computable yielded the same set of computable functions led to the proposal of Church's thesis, which says that all computing devices can be simulated by a Turing machine. This thesis greatly simplifies the study of computation, since it reduces the potential field of study from any of an infinite number of potential computing devices to Turing ma-chines. Church's thesis is not a mathematical theorem; to make it one would require a precise mathematical description of a computing device. Such a description, how-ever, would leave open the possibility of some practical computing device which did not satisfy this precise mathematical description and thus would make the resulting theorem weaker than Church's original thesis. With the development of practical computers, it became apparent that the dis-tinction between computable and noncomputable functions was much too coarse; com-puter scientists are now interested in the exact efficiency with which specific functions can be computed. This exact efficiency, on the other hand, was found to be too precise a quantity to work with easily. The generally accepted compromise between coarse-ness and precision distinguishes efficiently from inefficiently computable functions by whether the length of the computation scales polynomially or superpolynomially with the input size. The class of problems which can be solved by algorithms having a number of steps polynomial in the input size is known as P. For this classification to make sense, it must be machine independent. That is, the question of whether a function is computable in polynomial time must be independent},

@article{Dikarov2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society.Electron spins in solids have a central role in many current and future spin-based devices, ranging from sensitive sensors to quantum computers. Many of these apparatuses rely on the formation of well-defined spin structures (e.g., a 2D array) with controlled and well-characterized spin-spin interactions. While being essential for device operation, these interactions can also result in undesirable effects, such as decoherence. Arguably, the most important pure quantum interaction that causes decoherence is known as the "flip-flop" process, where two interacting spins interchange their quantum state. Currently, for electron spins, the rate of this process can only be estimated theoretically, or measured indirectly, under limiting assumptions and approximations, via spin-relaxation data. This work experimentally demonstrates how the flip-flop rate can be directly and accurately measured by examining spin-diffusion processes in the solid state for physically fixed spins. Under such terms, diffusion can occur only through this flip-flop-mediated quantum-state exchange and not via actual spatial motion. Our approach is implemented on two types of samples, phosphorus-doped Si28 and nitrogen vacancies in diamond, both of which are significantly relevant to quantum sensors and information processing. However, while the results for the former sample are conclusive and reveal a flip-flop rate of approximately 12.3 Hz, for the latter sample only an upper limit of approximately 0.2 Hz for this rate can be estimated.},

From the temperature dependence of the pulse height and the time structure, we have obtained values for the lattice contribution to the heat capacity in excellent agreement with theory, while the contributions from the implanted zone are about an order of magnitude larger than expected from data on diffusion-doped semiconductor. This and other thermal properties are discussed.},

@article{Cywinski2008,
abstract = {We theoretically investigate the influence of designed pulse sequences in restoring quantum coherence lost due to background noise in superconducting qubits. We consider both 1/f noise and Random Telegraph Noise, and show that the qubit coherence time can be substantially enhanced by carefully engineered pulse sequences. Conversely, the time dependence of qubit coherence under external pulse sequences could be used as a spectroscopic tool for extracting the noise mechanisms in superconducting qubits, i.e. by using Uhrig's pulse sequence one can obtain information about moments of the spectral density of noise. We also study the effect of pulse sequences on the evolution of the qubit affected by a strongly coupled fluctuator, and show that the non-Gaussian features in decoherence are suppressed by the application of pulses.},

@article{Doherty2013,
abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) colour centre in diamond is an important physical system for emergent quantum technologies, including quantum metrology, information processing and communications, as well as for various nanotechnologies, such as biological and sub-diffraction limit imaging, and for tests of entanglement in quantum mechanics. Given this array of existing and potential applications and the almost 50 years of NV research, one would expect that the physics of the centre is well understood, however, the study of the NV centre has proved challenging, with many early assertions now believed false and many remaining issues yet to be resolved. This review represents the first time that the key empirical and ab initio results have been extracted from the extensive NV literature and assembled into one consistent picture of the current understanding of the centre. As a result, the key unresolved issues concerning the NV centre are identified and the possible avenues for their resolution are examined. {\textcopyright} 2013.},
