abstract = {We present and characterize fiber mirrors and a miniaturized ion-trap design developed to integrate a fiber-based Fabry-Perot cavity (FFPC) with a linear Paul trap for use in cavity-QED experiments with trapped ions. Our fiber-mirror fabrication process not only enables the construction of FFPCs with small mode volumes, but also allows us to minimize the influence of the dielectric fiber mirrors on the trapped-ion pseudopotential. We discuss the effect of clipping losses for long FFPCs and the effect of angular and lateral displacements on the coupling efficiencies between cavity and fiber. Optical profilometry allows us to determine the radii of curvature and ellipticities of the fiber mirrors. From finesse measurements we infer a single-atom cooperativity of up to {\$}12{\$} for FFPCs longer than {\$}200 \backslashmu{\$}m in length; comparison to cavities constructed with reference substrate mirrors produced in the same coating run indicates that our FFPCs have similar scattering losses. We discuss experiments to anneal fiber mirrors and explore the influence of the atmosphere under which annealing occurs on coating losses, finding that annealing under vacuum increases the losses for our reference substrate mirrors. Our unique linear Paul trap design provides clearance for such a cavity and is miniaturized to shield trapped ions from the dielectric fiber mirrors. We numerically calculate the trap potential in the absence of fibers. In the experiment additional electrodes can be used to compensate distortions of the potential due to the fibers. Home-built fiber feedthroughs connect the FFPC to external optics, and an integrated nanopositioning system affords the possibility of retracting or realigning the cavity without breaking vacuum.},

abstract = {High spatial resolution magnetic imaging has driven important developments in fields ranging from materials science to biology. However, to uncover finer details approaching the nanoscale with greater sensitivity requires the development of a radically new sensor technology. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond has emerged as a promising candidate for such a sensor based on its atomic size and quantum-limited sensing capabilities afforded by long spin coherence times. Although the NV center has been successfully implemented as a nanoscale scanning magnetic probe at room temperature, it has remained an outstanding challenge to extend this capability to cryogenic temperatures, where many solid-state systems exhibit non-trivial magnetic order. Here we present NV magnetic imaging down to 6 K with 6 nm spatial resolution and 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}T/{\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashmbox{\{}Hz{\}}{\}}{\$} field sensitivity, first benchmarking the technique with a magnetic hard disk sample, then utilizing the technique to image vortices in the iron pnictide superconductor BaFe{\$}{\_}2{\$}(As{\$}{\_}{\{}0.7{\}}{\$}P{\$}{\_}{\{}0.3{\}}{\$}){\$}{\_}2{\$} with {\$}T{\_}c{\$} = 30 K.

@article{Tesche1977,
abstract = {A computer model is described for the dc SQUID in which the two Josephson junctions are nonhysteretic, resistively shunted tunnel junctions. In the absence of noise, current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are obtained as functions of the applied flux, dPa, SQUID inductance L, junction critical current Io, and shunt resistance R. The effects of asymmetry in L, Io, and R are discussed. I-V characteristics, flux-voltage transfer functions, and low-frequency spectral densities of the voltage noise are obtained at experimentally interesting values of the parameters in the presence of Johnson noise in the resistive shunts. The transfer functions and voltage spectral densities are used to calculate the flux and energy resolution of the SQUID operated as an open-loop, small-signal amplifier. The resolution of the SQUID with ac flux modulation is discussed. The flux resolution calculated for the SQUID of Clarke, Goubau, and Ketchen is 1.6 × 10-5{\~{}}o Hz -1/2, approximately one-half the experimental value. Optimization of the SQUID resolution is discussed: It is shown that the optimum operating condition is/3 = 2LI0/dP0{\~{}}l. Finally, some speculations are made on the ultimate performance of the tunnel junction de SQUID. When the dominant noise source is Johnson noise in the resistive shunts, the energy resolu on per m is 4k.T(LClI 2, where C is the junction capacitance, and the constraint R = ({\~{}}o/27rCI0) / has been imposed. This result implies that the energy resolution is proportional to (function area) 1/2. In the limit eIoR {\textgreater}{\textgreater} kBT, the dominant noise source is shot noise in the junctions; for/3 = 1, the energy resolution per Hz is then approximately h/2.},

abstract = {Recently the question of whether the D-Wave processors exhibit large-scale quantum behavior or can be described by a classical model has attracted significant interest. In this work we address this question by studying a 503 qubit D-Wave Two device in the "black box" model, i.e., by studying its input-output behavior. Our work generalizes an approach introduced in Boixo et al. [Nat. Commun. 4, 2067 (2013)], and uses groups of up to 20 qubits to realize a transverse Ising model evolution with a ground state degeneracy whose distribution acts as a sensitive probe that distinguishes classical and quantum models for the D-Wave device. Our findings rule out all classical models proposed to date for the device and provide evidence that an open system quantum dynamical description of the device that starts from a quantized energy level structure is well justified, even in the presence of relevant thermal excitations and a small value of the ratio of the single-qubit decoherence time to the annealing time.},

This article reviews the current status of this subject, including both recent advances and well-established results. The primary focus is on the basic physical principles underlying the generation of carrier spin polarization, spin dynamics, and spin-polarized transport in semiconductors and metals. Spin transport differs from charge transport in that spin is a nonconserved quantity in solids due to spin-orbit and hyperfine coupling. The authors discuss in detail spin decoherence mechanisms in metals and semiconductors. Various theories of spin injection and spin-polarized transport are applied to hybrid structures relevant to spin-based devices and fundamental studies of materials properties. Experimental work is reviewed with the emphasis on projected applications, in which external electric and magnetic fields and illumination by light will be used to control spin and charge dynamics to create new functionalities not feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics.},

The fidelity of the resulting entanglement is extremely robust against the most important errors such as detector loss, spontaneous emission, and mismatch of cavity parameters.

abstract = {We present new MCMC algorithms for com- puting the posterior distributions and expec- tations of the unknown variables in undi- rected graphical models with regular struc- ture. For demonstration purposes, we fo- cus on Markov Random Fields (MRFs). By partitioning the MRFs into non-overlapping trees, it is possible to compute the posterior distribution of a particular tree exactly by conditioning on the remaining tree. These exact solutions allow us to construct effi- cient blocked and Rao-Blackwellised MCMC algorithms. We show empirically that tree sampling is considerably more efficient than other partitioned sampling schemes and the naive Gibbs sampler, even in cases where loopy belief propagation fails to converge. We prove that tree sampling exhibits lower variance than the naive Gibbs sampler and other naive partitioning schemes using the theoretical measure of maximal correlation. We also construct new information theory tools for comparing different MCMC schemes and show that, under these, tree sampling is more efficient.},

abstract = {The great potential of quantum computing requires two essential ingredients for its realization: high-fidelity quantum logic operations and a physical implementation which can be scaled up to large numbers of quantum bits. We introduce a trapped-ion qubit stored in ultrastable "atomic clock" states of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}43{\}}{\$}Ca{\$}{\^{}}+{\$}, in which we implement all single-qubit operations with fidelities significantly above the minimum threshold required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We measure a combined qubit state preparation and single-shot readout fidelity of 99.93{\%}, a memory coherence time of T{\$}{\_}2{\^{}}*{\$} = 50 seconds, and an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.9999{\%}. These results are achieved in a room-temperature device without the use of magnetic field shielding or dynamic decoupling techniques to overcome technical noise. The surface-electrode ion trap chip incorporates integrated resonators and waveguides for coherent manipulation of the qubit using near-field microwaves. Two-qubit gates and individual qubit addressing have already been demonstrated using this approach, which is scalable for a many-qubit architecture.},

Benjamin  Affiliations Corresponding authors  Nature Physics (2011) doi:10.1038/nphys2148  Published online 30 October 2011  Defects in diamond crystals possess rare physical properties that can enable new forms of technology. Unlocking this potential requires rapid quantum-state measurement, a 'quantum snapshot', which has now been achieved. Article tools   When Nic{\'{e}}phore Ni{\'{e}}pce created the first photographic images in the 1820s, each frame required eight hours of exposure. Fifty years later, technology had advanced enough for Eadweard Muybridge's famous demonstration that horses become 'airborne' in mid-stride (see Fig. 1). Photography had become a tool to investigate timescales beyond human perception. Numerous devices now depend on swift measurement, but none more so than the emerging family of quantum technologies. These use measurement not only to read out, but also to prepare and entangle quantum states to create exotic new sensors, simulators and computers. A certain kind of defect that occurs in diamond, the so-called nitrogen–vacancy (NV) centre, is endowed with exceptional physical properties, making it particularly suitable for use in such technologies. But there has been a problem: making measurements on them takes too long. Muybridge's cameras recorded successive images on a timescale that was fast when compared with the horse's motion, but until now the devices monitoring NV centres have not achieved the same. Reporting in Nature, two research teams have now demonstrated the ability to take quantum 'snapshots' in rapid succession, thus recording the full state of the NV-centre complex more rapidly than it evolves1, 2.},

abstract = {A small-area contact between two pieces of superconducting metal or alloy is a remarkably sensitive and convenient device for demonstrating long-range quantum interference effects. It has been shown in many experiments that the critical supercurrent through a pair of such contacts in a parallel superconducting circuit has a component periodic in the flux enclosed by the topological ring formed by the parallel circuit, the periodicity being h/2e, showing that the wave function is coherent around the ring. With this configuration we have demonstrated coherence lengths of the order of millimeters or centimeters in Nb, V, Ta, Sn, Pb, and Nb0.85 Zr0.15, in rings where the enclosed area was as large as 1 cm2, so that the periodicity in applied field was of the order of 10-7 G. Both bulk and thin-film materials have been used. These experiments provide general proof of London's concept of long-range phase coherence in both type-I and type-II superconductors, and in addition lead to useful laboratory instruments. We have used such devices to show quantized flux pinning in bulk type-II superconductors and to measure the magnetic field of a rotating superconductor.},

abstract = {With qubit measurement and control fidelities above the threshold of fault-tolerance, much attention is moving towards the daunting task of scaling up the number of physical qubits to the large numbers needed for fault tolerant quantum computing. Here, quantum dot based spin qubits may offer significant advantages due to their potential for high densities, all-electrical operation, and integration onto an industrial platform. In this system, the initialisation, readout, single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in various qubit representations. However, as seen with other small scale quantum computer demonstrations, combining these elements leads to new challenges involving qubit crosstalk, state leakage, calibration, and control hardware which provide invaluable insight towards scaling up. Here we address these challenges and demonstrate a programmable two-qubit quantum processor in silicon by performing both the Deutsch-Josza and the Grover search algorithms. In addition, we characterise the entanglement in our processor through quantum state tomography of Bell states measuring state fidelities between 85-89{\%} and concurrences between 73-80{\%}. These results pave the way for larger scale quantum computers using spins confined to quantum dots.},

Our goal is to determine for which {\$}\backslashrho{\$} universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of {\$}\backslashrho{\$} and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain ``magic'' directions. If the polarization of {\$}\backslashrho{\$} along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65{\%}), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

However, the low spin number sensitivity of the technique continues to pose serious limitations. Here we demonstrate that signal intensity in a pulsed Davies ENDOR experiment depends strongly on the nuclear relaxation time T(1n), and can be severely reduced for long T(1n). We suggest a development of the original Davies ENDOR sequence that overcomes this limitation, thus offering dramatically enhanced signal intensity and spectral resolution. Finally, we observe that the sensitivity of the original Davies method to T(1n) can be exploited to measure nuclear relaxation, as we demonstrate for phosphorous donors in silicon and for endohedral fullerenes N@C(60) in CS(2).},

A steady state method was employed, in which the conduction electron lifetime tL is equal to ne$\tau$i/NoD. ne is the conduction electron concentration which is determined from low temperature photo-Hall measurements, and NOD$\tau$i is the electron generation rate. The neutral donor concentration No is measured by the Hall effect and Ti, the lifetime against photoionization of a neutral donor, is obtained directly by an electron spin resonance technique. The trapping lifetimes tL are generally independent of temperature between 4-2°K and 1–2°K, and are inversely proportional to the compensating acceptor concentration. This latter was determined using a recently developed combined infrared radiation and spin resonance method. The trapping cross-section result for phosphorus donors is about 5 × 10−12 cm2 at 3°K. This is about an order of magnitude larger than the value obtained from the giant trap theory of Lax. Also, the concentration independence of the cross-section in the region of temperature independent tL. is not easily accounted for. The mobility of electrons photoexcited with 2 micron radiation considerably exceeds the mobility of electrons photoexcited with 8–25 micron radiation. This suggests the possibility of excitation to another band or minimum by the 2 micron radiation, as is also suggested by the free carrier absorption peak near 2 microns found in n-type silicon by Spitzer and Fan.},

abstract = {The detection of ensembles of spins under ambient conditions has revolutionized the biological, chemical, and physical sciences through magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Pushing sensing capabilities to the individual-spin level would enable unprecedented applications such as single molecule structural imaging; however, the weak magnetic fields from single spins are undetectable by conventional far-field resonance techniques. In recent years, there has been a considerable effort to develop nanoscale scanning magnetometers, which are able to measure fewer spins by bringing the sensor in close proximity to its target. The most sensitive of these magnetometers generally require low temperatures for operation, but measuring under ambient conditions (standard temperature and pressure) is critical for many imaging applications, particularly in biological systems. Here we demonstrate detection and nanoscale imaging of the magnetic field from a single electron spin under ambient conditions using a scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometer. Real-space, quantitative magnetic-field images are obtained by deterministically scanning our NV magnetometer 50 nanometers above a target electron spin, while measuring the local magnetic field using dynamically decoupled magnetometry protocols. This single-spin detection capability could enable single-spin magnetic resonance imaging of electron spins on the nano- and atomic scales and opens the door for unique applications such as mechanical quantum state transfer.},

abstract = {In the evaluation of quantum annealers, metrics based on ground state success rates have two major drawbacks. First, evaluation requires computation time for both quantum and classical processors that grows exponentially with problem size. This makes evaluation itself computationally prohibitive. Second, results are heavily dependent on the effects of analog noise on the quantum processors, which is an engineering issue that complicates the study of the underlying quantum annealing algorithm. We introduce a novel "time-to-target" metric which avoids these two issues by challenging software solvers to match the results obtained by a quantum annealer in a short amount of time. We evaluate D-Wave's latest quantum annealer, the D-Wave 2X system, on an array of problem classes and find that it performs well on several input classes relative to state of the art software solvers running single-threaded on a CPU.},

The experiments were performed at 1.25K and 9000 Mc/sec on silicon samples subjected to strains up to 10-3. From the reduction in the hyperfine splitting and the observed g anisotropy under strain the following results were deduced: For a deformation potential of 11 ev, the valley-orbit splitting (i.e., singlet-doublet spacing) for phosphorus was found to be 0.015 ev, for arsenic 0.023 ev, and for antimony 0.013 ev. For the difference in g values with H parallel (gII) and H perpendicular (g) to the valley axis we obtained for phosphorus-doped silicon, gII-g=(1.040.04)10-3.The observed g shifts with strains along different crystallographic directions revealed the presence of two distinct spin-lattice relaxation (Ts) mechanisms. These were verified and compared with the theory of Roth and Hasegawa. The effect of applied strains on the mutual electron-nuclear spin flip rate (Tx) has been demonstrated. The importance of strain experiments in unravelling relaxation mechanisms is discussed.},

abstract = {In theory, quantum computers offer a means of solving problems that would be intractable on conventional computers. Assuming that a quantum computer could be constructed, it would in practice be required to function with noisy devices called 'gates'. These gates cause decoherence of the fragile quantum states that are central to the computer's operation. The goal of so-called 'fault-tolerant quantum computing' is therefore to compute accurately even when the error probability per gate (EPG) is high. Here we report a simple architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing, providing evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible for EPGs as high as three per cent. Such EPGs have been experimentally demonstrated, but to avoid excessive resource overheads required by the necessary architecture, lower EPGs are needed. Assuming the availability of quantum resources comparable to the digital resources available in today's computers, we show that non-trivial quantum computations at EPGs of as high as one per cent could be implemented.},

Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10{\^{}}6 qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}, would be a formidable factoring engine.

Establishing entanglement between remote quantum nodes would further require the photons generated from separate nodes to be indistinguishable. Here, we report the observation of correlations between a quantum-dot spin and a telecom single photon across a 2-km fibre channel based on time-bin encoding and background-free frequency downconversion. The downconverted photon at telecom wavelengths exhibits two-photon interference with another photon from an independent source, achieving a mean wavepacket overlap of greater than 0.89 despite their original wavelength mismatch (900 and 911 nm).

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

There is growing interest in Si:Bi as an alternative to the well-studied proposals for silicon based quantum computing using phosphorus-doped silicon (Si:P). We focus here on the implications of the anomalously-strong hyperfine coupling. In particular, we analyse in detail the regime where recent 4 GHz pulsed magnetic resonance experiments have demonstrated orders of magnitude speed-up in quantum gates involving transitions which are forbidden at high fields. We also present calculations using a phenomenological Markovian master equation which models the decoherence of the electron spin due to Gaussian temporal magnetic field perturbations. The model quantifies the advantages of certain "optimal working points" identified as the {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}df{\}}{\{}dB{\}}=0{\$} regions, which come in the form of frequency minima and maxima. We show that at such regions, dephasing due to the interaction of the electron spin with a fluctuating magnetic field in the {\$}z{\$} direction (usually adiabatic) is completely removed.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"{a}}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry--calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He-H(+). The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

A detailed study of many electron spin relaxation processes is carried out. It is found that for sufficiently low concentrations of P, As, and Sb impurities in silicon transient nuclear polarization should occur; for Li impurities it should not.

abstract = {In recent years, surface codes have become a leading method for quantum error correction in theoretical large scale computational and communications architecture designs. Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and their natural 2-dimensional nearest neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an obvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems. While fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants, two of which are the planar- and defect- based codes. Planar codes require fewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are restricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between encoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the inherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique enabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations, maintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique comprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform universal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing the need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the overall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further reduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how lattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct (and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT between two distance 3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half of that required in any other known construction in 2D.},

@article{Hensen2015,
abstract = {For more than 80 years, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum theory have stimulated debate about the nature of reality. In his seminal work, John Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local realist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an inequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to quantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades, numerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because of experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in loopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of high-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin readout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use of fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions. We perform 245 trials testing the CHSH-Bell inequality {\$}S \backslashleq 2{\$} and find {\$}S = 2.42 \backslashpm 0.20{\$}. A null hypothesis test yields a probability of {\$}p = 0.039{\$} that a local-realist model for space-like separated sites produces data with a violation at least as large as observed, even when allowing for memory in the devices. This result rules out large classes of local realist theories, and paves the way for implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication and randomness certification.},

abstract = {Many interesting but practically intractable problems can be reduced to that of finding the ground state of a system of interacting spins; however, finding such a ground state remains computationally difficult. It is believed that the ground state of some naturally occurring spin systems can be effectively attained through a process called quantum annealing. If it could be harnessed, quantum annealing might improve on known methods for solving certain types of problem. However, physical investigation of quantum annealing has been largely confined to microscopic spins in condensed-matter systems. Here we use quantum annealing to find the ground state of an artificial Ising spin system comprising an array of eight superconducting flux quantum bits with programmable spin-spin couplings. We observe a clear signature of quantum annealing, distinguishable from classical thermal annealing through the temperature dependence of the time at which the system dynamics freezes. Our implementation can be configured in situ to realize a wide variety of different spin networks, each of which can be monitored as it moves towards a low-energy configuration. This programmable artificial spin network bridges the gap between the theoretical study of ideal isolated spin networks and the experimental investigation of bulk magnetic samples. Moreover, with an increased number of spins, such a system may provide a practical physical means to implement a quantum algorithm, possibly allowing more-effective approaches to solving certain classes of hard combinatorial optimization problems.},

abstract = {The elimination of defects from SiC has facilitated its move to the forefront of the optoelectronics and power-electronics industries. Nonetheless, because certain SiC defects have electronic states with sharp optical and spin transitions, they are increasingly recognized as a platform for quantum information and nanoscale sensing. Here, we show that individual electron spins in high-purity monocrystalline 4H-SiC can be isolated and coherently controlled. Bound to neutral divacancy defects, these states exhibit exceptionally long ensemble Hahn-echo spin coherence times, exceeding 1 ms. Coherent control of single spins in a material amenable to advanced growth and microfabrication techniques is an exciting route towards wafer-scale quantum technologies.},

Effectively, the interaction with the environment is reduced. In particular, a sequence of $\pi$ pulses is considered. Here we present exact results on the suppression of the coupling of a quantum bit to its environment by optimized sequences of $\pi$ pulses. The effect of various cut-offs of the spectral density of the environment is investigated. As a result we show that the harder the cut-off is, the better an optimized pulse sequence can deal with it. For cut-offs which are neither completely hard nor very soft we advocate iterated optimized sequences.},

This makes the development of quantum error correction an essential aspect of quantum computing. So far, little is known about protection against decoherence for quantum annealing, a computational paradigm aiming to exploit ground-state quantum dynamics to solve optimization problems more rapidly than is possible classically. Here we develop error correction for quantum annealing and experimentally demonstrate it using antiferromagnetic chains with up to 344 superconducting flux qubits in processors that have recently been shown to physically implement programmable quantum annealing. We demonstrate a substantial improvement over the performance of the processors in the absence of error correction. These results pave the way towards large-scale noise-protected adiabatic quantum optimization devices, although a threshold theorem such as has been established in the circuit model of quantum computing remains elusive.},

abstract = {The spin lifetime and diffusion length of electrons are transport parameters that define the scale of coherence in spintronic devices and circuits. As these parameters are many orders of magnitude larger in semiconductors than in metals, semiconductors could be the most suitable for spintronics. So far, spin transport has only been measured in direct-bandgap semiconductors or in combination with magnetic semiconductors, excluding a wide range of non-magnetic semiconductors with indirect bandgaps. Most notable in this group is silicon, Si, which (in addition to its market entrenchment in electronics) has long been predicted a superior semiconductor for spintronics with enhanced lifetime and transport length due to low spin-orbit scattering and lattice inversion symmetry. Despite this promise, a demonstration of coherent spin transport in Si has remained elusive, because most experiments focused on magnetoresistive devices; these methods fail because of a fundamental impedance mismatch between ferromagnetic metal and semiconductor, and measurements are obscured by other magnetoelectronic effects. Here we demonstrate conduction-band spin transport across 10 mum undoped Si in a device that operates by spin-dependent ballistic hot-electron filtering through ferromagnetic thin films for both spin injection and spin detection. As it is not based on magnetoresistance, the hot-electron spin injection and spin detection avoids impedance mismatch issues and prevents interference from parasitic effects. The clean collector current shows independent magnetic and electrical control of spin precession, and thus confirms spin coherent drift in the conduction band of silicon.},

Its highly advanced fabrication technology facilitates the transition from individual devices to large-scale processors, and the availability of an isotopically-purified {\$}{\^{}}{\{}28{\}}{\$}Si form with no magnetic nuclei overcomes what is a main source of spin decoherence in many other materials. Nevertheless, the coherence lifetimes of electron spins in the solid state have typically remained several orders of magnitude lower than what can be achieved in isolated high-vacuum systems such as trapped ions. Here we examine electron spin coherence of donors in very pure {\$}{\^{}}{\{}28{\}}{\$}Si material, with a residual {\$}{\^{}}{\{}29{\}}{\$}Si concentration of less than 50 ppm and donor densities of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}14-15{\}}{\$} per cm{\$}{\^{}}3{\$}.

We apply a magnetic field gradient in order to suppress such interactions and obtain an extrapolated electron spin {\$}T{\_}2{\$} of 10 seconds at 1.8 K. These coherence lifetimes are without peer in the solid state by several orders of magnitude and comparable with high-vacuum qubits, making electron spins of donors in silicon ideal components of a quantum computer, or quantum memories for systems such as superconducting qubits.},

An a. c. electric-field sensitivity reaching 202 +/- 6 Vcm(-1) Hz(-1/2) has been achieved. This corresponds to the electric field produced by a single elementary charge located at a distance of similar to 150nm from our spin sensor with averaging for one second. The analysis of the electronic structure of the defect centre reveals how an applied magnetic field influences the electric-field-sensing properties. We also demonstrate that diamond-defect-centre spins can be switched between electric-and magnetic-field sensing modes and identify suitable parameter ranges for both detector schemes.

Motivated by recent experiments, we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be expected. Although a better scaling is seen for QA in two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, this advantage is due to time discretization artifacts and measurements that are not possible on a physical quantum annealer. Simulations in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not show superiority.

abstract = {A scalable quantum computer could be built by networking together many simple processor cells, thus avoiding the need to create a single complex structure. The difficulty is that realistic quantum links are very error prone. A solution is for cells to repeatedly communicate with each other and so purify any imperfections; however prior studies suggest that the cells themselves must then have prohibitively low internal error rates. Here we describe a method by which even error-prone cells can perform purification: groups of cells generate shared resource states, which then enable stabilization of topologically encoded data. Given a realistically noisy network (≥10{\%} error rate) we find that our protocol can succeed provided that intra-cell error rates for initialisation, state manipulation and measurement are below 0.82{\%}. This level of fidelity is already achievable in several laboratory systems.},

The field of quantum error correction has developed to meet this challenge. A group-theoretical structure and associated subclass of quantum codes, the stabilizer codes, has proved particularly fruitful in producing codes and in understanding the structure of both specific codes and classes of codes. I will give an overview of the field of quantum error correction and the formalism of stabilizer codes. In the context of stabilizer codes, I will discuss a number of known codes, the capacity of a quantum channel, bounds on quantum codes, and fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

abstract = {Donors in silicon are now demonstrated as one of the leading candidates for implementing qubits and quantum information processing. Single qubit operations, measurements and long coherence times are firmly established, but progress on controlling two qubit interactions has been slower. One reason for this is that the inter donor exchange coupling has been predicted to oscillate with separation, making it hard to estimate in device designs. We present a multi-valley effective mass theory of a donor pair in silicon, including both a central cell potential and the effective mass anisotropy intrinsic in the Si conduction band. We are able to accurately describe the single donor properties of valley-orbit coupling and the spatial extent of donor wave functions, leading to hyperfine interaction values in close agreement with experiment. Ours is a simple framework that can be applied flexibly to a range of experimental scenarios, but it is nonetheless able to provide fast and reliable predictions. We use it to estimate the exchange coupling between two donor electrons and we find a smoothing of its expected oscillations, and predict a monotonic dependence on separation if two donors are spaced precisely along the [100] direction.},

We then demonstrate two different methods to use a DC electric field combined with an applied resonant radio-frequency (RF) field to conditionally control donor nuclear spins. The first method combines an electric-field induced conditional phase gate with standard RF pulses, and the second one simply detunes the spins off-resonance. Finally, we consider different strategies to reduce the effect of electric field inhomogeneities and obtain above 90{\%} process fidelities.},

However, a key challenge for such solid-state systems is to realize a spin coherence time that is much longer than the time for quantum spin manipulation protocols. Here we demonstrate an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in the spin coherence time (T₂) of nitrogen-vacancy centres compared with previous measurements: T₂≈0.6 s at 77 K. We employed dynamical decoupling pulse sequences to suppress nitrogen-vacancy spin decoherence, and found that T₂ is limited to approximately half of the longitudinal spin relaxation time over a wide range of temperatures, which we attribute to phonon-induced decoherence. Our results apply to ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy spins, and thus could advance quantum sensing, enable squeezing and many-body entanglement, and open a path to simulating driven, interaction-dominated quantum many-body Hamiltonians.},

abstract = {A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time by at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. 1. Introduction. One of the first results in the mathematics of computation, which underlies the subsequent development of much of theoretical computer science, was the distinction between computable and noncomputable functions shown in pa-pers of Church [1936], Post [1936], and Turing [1936]. The observation that several apparently different definitions of what it meant for a function to be computable yielded the same set of computable functions led to the proposal of Church's thesis, which says that all computing devices can be simulated by a Turing machine. This thesis greatly simplifies the study of computation, since it reduces the potential field of study from any of an infinite number of potential computing devices to Turing ma-chines. Church's thesis is not a mathematical theorem; to make it one would require a precise mathematical description of a computing device. Such a description, how-ever, would leave open the possibility of some practical computing device which did not satisfy this precise mathematical description and thus would make the resulting theorem weaker than Church's original thesis. With the development of practical computers, it became apparent that the dis-tinction between computable and noncomputable functions was much too coarse; com-puter scientists are now interested in the exact efficiency with which specific functions can be computed. This exact efficiency, on the other hand, was found to be too precise a quantity to work with easily. The generally accepted compromise between coarse-ness and precision distinguishes efficiently from inefficiently computable functions by whether the length of the computation scales polynomially or superpolynomially with the input size. The class of problems which can be solved by algorithms having a number of steps polynomial in the input size is known as P. For this classification to make sense, it must be machine independent. That is, the question of whether a function is computable in polynomial time must be independent},

Superconducting quantum interference devices ͑SQUIDs͒ have been a key factor in the development and commercialization of ultrasensitive electric and magnetic measurement systems. In many cases, SQUID instrumentation offers the ability to make measurements where no other methodology is possible. We review the main aspects of designing, fabricating, and operating a number of SQUID measurement systems. While this article is not intended to be an exhaustive review on the principles of SQUID sensors and the underlying concepts behind the Josephson effect, a qualitative description of the operating principles of SQUID sensors and the properties of materials used to fabricate SQUID sensors is presented. The difference between low and high temperature SQUIDs and their suitability for specific applications is discussed. Although SQUID electronics have the capability to operate well above 1 MHz, most applications tend to be at lower frequencies. Specific examples of input circuits and detection coil configuration for different applications and environments, along with expected performance, are described. In particular, anticipated signal strength, magnetic field environment ͑applied field and external noise͒, and cryogenic requirements are discussed. Finally, a variety of applications with specific examples in the areas of electromagnetic, material property, nondestructive test and evaluation, and geophysical and biomedical measurements are reviewed.},

@article{Clarke1976,
abstract = {We describe the theory, fabrication, operation, and performance of a cylindrical dc SQUID made with shunted Nb-NbOx-Pb Josephson tunnel junctions. The SQUID is current-biased at a nonzero voltage, and modulated with a 100 kHz flux. The 100 kHz voltage developed across the SQUID is amplified by a cooled, resonantLC circuit that optimally couples the SQUID impedance to the input of a room-temperature FET preamplifier. The SQUID is operated in a flux-locked loop with a dynamic range in a 1-Hz bandwidth of ±3×106. The 3-dB rolloff frequency for the loop response is typicalty 2 kHz, and the slewing rate is generally 2×104 f0 sec-1. A typical flux noise power spectrum for a SQUID at 4.2 K in a superconducting shield is presented. Above 2×10-2 Hz the spectrum is white and has an rms value of 3.5×10-5 f0 Hz-1/2. The white noise is intrinsic to the sensor and is close to the theoretical limit set by Johnson noise in the shunts. At lower frequencies, the power spectrum is approximately 10-10 (1 Hz/f) f02 Hz-1, wheref is the frequency. This value is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the calculated 1/f noise in the tunnel junctions. The factors contributing to the long-term drift of the SQUID are discussed. By regulating the temperature of the helium bath we have achieved a drift rate of 2×10-5 f0 h-1 over a 20-h period. A detailed description is given of the coupling efficiency of various input coils wound on the SQUID. The effects of coupling between the input coil, the SQUID, and the feedback (modulation) coil are described, and measurements of the coupling parameters reported. The energy resolution of the SQUID with respect to a current in a 24-turn input coil is 7×10-30 J Hz-1 for frequencies at which the flux noise has a white power spectrum. In terms of energy resolution, the SQUID has a better performance in the 1/f noise region that that of any SQUID previously reported in the literature. The long-term drift over an extended period also represents the lowest value yet reported.},

abstract = {Initialization and read-out of coupled quantum systems are essential ingredients for the implementation of quantum algorithms. Single-shot read-out of the state of a multi-quantum-bit (multi-qubit) register would allow direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement), and would give access to further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation. Although spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, their single-shot detection has been achieved only for isolated qubits. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register in a low-temperature solid-state system by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity read-out of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and use this read-out to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto, and subsequently measuring, the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control: we demonstrate initialization, coherent manipulation and single-shot read-out in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the way for a test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the implementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols.},

We will call such Hamiltonians, which are common in the natural world, stoquastic. An equivalent characterization of stoquastic Hamiltonians is that they have an entry-wise non-negative Gibbs density matrix for any temperature. We prove that LH-MIN for stoquastic Hamiltonians belongs to the complexity class AM -- a probabilistic version of NP with two rounds of communication between the prover and the verifier. We also show that 2-local stoquastic LH-MIN is hard for the class MA. With the additional promise of having a polynomial spectral gap, we show that stoquastic LH-MIN belongs to the class POSTBPP=BPPpath -- a generalization of BPP in which a post-selective readout is allowed. This last result also shows that any problem solved by adiabatic quantum computation using stoquastic Hamiltonians lies in PostBPP.},

Such a system is expected to correlate well with a proper quantum Monte Carlo simulation. It may also correlate with simulated annealing if at the freeze-out point the quantum energy eigenvalues are close to the classical ones. These correlations are just signatures of equilibration and do not mean that the evolution of the quantum annealer is classical or can be simulated by quantum Monte Carlo. The computation time extracted from such a distribution reflects the equilibrium behavior and therefore provides no information about the underlying quantum dynamics. This makes the search for quantum speedup in suboptimal quantum annealers problematic. We use an open quantum master equation with realistic parameters to illustrate quasistatic evolution in a 16 qubit quantum annealer and discuss its implication for quantum speedup.},

Here we demonstrate that signal intensity in a pulsed Davies ENDOR experiment depends strongly on the nuclear relaxation time T(1n), and can be severely reduced for long T(1n). We suggest a development of the original Davies ENDOR sequence that overcomes this limitation, thus offering dramatically enhanced signal intensity and spectral resolution. Finally, we observe that the sensitivity of the original Davies method to T(1n) can be exploited to measure nuclear relaxation, as we demonstrate for phosphorous donors in silicon and for endohedral fullerenes N@C(60) in CS(2).},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {Exquisite quantum control has now been achieved in small ion traps, in nitrogen-vacancy centres and in superconducting qubit clusters. We can regard such a system as a universal cell with diverse technological uses from communication to large-scale computing, provided that the cell is able to network with others and overcome any noise in the interlinks. Here we show that loss-tolerant entanglement purification makes quantum computing feasible with the noisy and lossy links that are realistic today: With a modestly complex cell design, and using a surface code protocol with a network noise threshold of 13.3{\%}, we find that interlinks which attempt entanglement at a rate of 2MHz but suffer 98{\%} photon loss can result in kilohertz computer clock speeds (i.e. rate of high fidelity stabilizer measurements). Improved links would dramatically increase the clock speed. Our simulations employed local gates of a fidelity already achieved in ion trap devices.},

abstract = {The performance of a D-Wave Vesuvius quantum annealer was recently compared to a suite of classical algorithms on a class of constraint satisfaction instances based on frustrated loops. However, the construction of these instances leads the maximum coupling strength to increase with problem size. As a result, larger instances are subject to amplified analog control error, and are effectively annealed at higher temperatures in both hardware and software. We generate similar constraint satisfaction instances with limited range of coupling strength and perform a similar comparison to classical algorithms. On these instances the D-Wave Vesuvius processor, run with a fixed 20{\$}\backslashmu{\$}s anneal time, shows a scaling advantage over the software solvers for the hardest regime studied. This scaling advantage opens the possibility of quantum speedup on these problems. Our results support the hypothesis that performance of D-Wave Vesuvius processors is heavily influenced by analog control error, which can be reduced and mitigated as the technology matures.},

Here we provide a more complete analysis of this scheme, including several generalizations. We generalize the interaction to an anisotropic form (incorporating the XY, or Forster, interaction as a limit), providing a proof that a chain coupled in this fashion tends to an effective Ising chain in the limit of far off-resonant spins. We derive the primitive two-qubit gate that results from exploiting abrupt Zeeman tuning with such an interaction. We also demonstrate, via numerical simulation, that the same basic scheme functions in the case of smoothly shifted Zeeman energies. We conclude with some remarks regarding generalisations to two- and three-dimensional arrays.},

abstract = {In the evaluation of quantum annealers, metrics based on ground state success rates have two major drawbacks. First, evaluation requires computation time for both quantum and classical processors that grows exponentially with problem size. This makes evaluation itself computationally prohibitive. Second, results are heavily dependent on the effects of analog noise on the quantum processors, which is an engineering issue that complicates the study of the underlying quantum annealing algorithm. We introduce a novel "time-to-target" metric which avoids these two issues by challenging software solvers to match the results obtained by a quantum annealer in a short amount of time. We evaluate D-Wave's latest quantum annealer, the D-Wave 2X system, on an array of problem classes and find that it performs well on several input classes relative to state of the art software solvers running single-threaded on a CPU.},

In this concentration dependent region T. was independent of the mag- netic field but depended on the number of acceptors present. None of the T, mechanisms can at present be accounted for by the theories of Pines, Bardeen, and Slichter, and Abrahams. The relaxation time T, (rim. ={\&}1,nmr={\&}l) was 30 hours at 3000 oersteds and 5 hours at 8000 oersteds in fair agreement with the theory of PBS.The relaxation time Tz (d znl =+1,Am, =0) at 1.25'K exceeded 10 hours.

The bottleneck in the T„-spin exchange mechanism sug- gested by PBS is the spin-lattice relaxation time of the free carriers. This bottleneck is absent in a double spin exchange mechanism suggested by Anderson and is responsible for the observed T„process. A resonant spin-spin interaction was observed between the electron bound to an iron impurity and the phosphorus donor electron when the magnetic Geld at which the two resonance lines overlap was traversed. The application of this "mixing" eRect to a nuclear polarization scheme is discussed. A complete mixing of two levels was also observed in phosphorus doped silicon at a magnetic field of 40 oersteds. A spin diRusion process capable of transmitting a spin excitation to diRerent parts of the resonance line was observed in arsenic doped silicon. This process proceeds in discrete steps with fre- quencies determined by the diRerent Larmor frequencies of the Si" nuclei situated at various lattice sites relative to the donor atom.},

Its advanced fabrication technology facilitates the transition from individual devices to large-scale processors, and the availability of a (28)Si form with no magnetic nuclei overcomes a primary source of spin decoherence in many other materials. Nevertheless, the coherence lifetimes of electron spins in the solid state have typically remained several orders of magnitude lower than that achieved in isolated high-vacuum systems such as trapped ions. Here we examine electron spin coherence of donors in pure (28)Si material (residual (29)Si concentration {\textless}50 ppm) with donor densities of 10(14)-10(15) cm(-3). We elucidate three mechanisms for spin decoherence, active at different temperatures, and extract a coherence lifetime T(2) up to 2 s. In this regime, we find the electron spin is sensitive to interactions with other donor electron spins separated by {\~{}}200 nm. A magnetic field gradient suppresses such interactions, producing an extrapolated electron spin T(2) of 10 s at 1.8 K. These coherence lifetimes are without peer in the solid state and comparable to high-vacuum qubits, making electron spins of donors in silicon ideal components of quantum computers, or quantum memories for systems such as superconducting qubits.},

Here, we use qubit tunneling spectroscopy to measure the energy eigenspectrum of two- and eight-qubit systems within one such processor, demonstrating quantum coherence in these systems.

abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond has potential applications in nanoscale electric and magnetic-field sensing, single-photon microscopy, quantum information processing and bioimaging. These applications rely on the ability to position a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within a few nanometres of a sample, and then scan it across the sample surface, while preserving the centre's spin coherence and readout fidelity. However, existing scanning techniques, which use a single diamond nanocrystal grafted onto the tip of a scanning probe microscope, suffer from short spin coherence times due to poor crystal quality, and from inefficient far-field collection of the fluorescence from the nitrogen-vacancy centre. Here, we demonstrate a robust method for scanning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within tens of nanometres from a sample surface that addresses both of these concerns. This is achieved by positioning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre at the end of a high-purity diamond nanopillar, which we use as the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our approach ensures long nitrogen-vacancy spin coherence times (∼75 µs), enhanced nitrogen-vacancy collection efficiencies due to waveguiding, and mechanical robustness of the device (several weeks of scanning time). We are able to image magnetic domains with widths of 25 nm, and demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of 56 nT Hz(-1/2) at a frequency of 33 kHz, which is unprecedented for scanning nitrogen-vacancy centres.},

We show that using local adiabatic evolution, a process in which the adiabatic procedure is performed at a variable rate, the problem is solved as efficiently as the analogous circuit-based algorithm, i.e., quadratically faster than the corresponding classical algorithm. The above algorithm provides further evidence for the potentially powerful capabilities of AQC as a paradigm for efficient problem solving on a quantum computer.

Here we discuss the more general set of such sequences, which we refer to as Saturated Pulsed ENDOR, and show how signal sensitivity can be optimised within the context of this new technique. Through simulations, we compare its performance to other techniques based on Davies ENDOR, and experimentally illustrate its properties using the non-heme Fe enzyme anthranilate dioxygenase AntDO.

This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {Given the effectiveness of semiconductor devices for classical computation one is naturally led to consider semiconductor systems for solid state quantum information processing. Semiconductors are particularly suitable where local control of electric fields and charge transport are required. Conventional semiconductor electronics is built upon these capabilities and has demonstrated scaling to large complicated arrays of interconnected devices. However, the requirements for a quantum computer are very different from those for classical computation, and it is not immediately obvious how best to build one in a semiconductor. One possible approach is to use spins as qubits: of nuclei, of electrons, or both in combination. Long qubit coherence times are a prerequisite for quantum computing, and in this paper we will discuss measurements of spin coherence in silicon. The results are encouraging - both electrons bound to donors and the donor nuclei exhibit low decoherence under the right circumstances. Doped silicon thus appears to pass the first test on the road to a quantum computer.},

@article{Dikarov2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society.Electron spins in solids have a central role in many current and future spin-based devices, ranging from sensitive sensors to quantum computers. Many of these apparatuses rely on the formation of well-defined spin structures (e.g., a 2D array) with controlled and well-characterized spin-spin interactions. While being essential for device operation, these interactions can also result in undesirable effects, such as decoherence. Arguably, the most important pure quantum interaction that causes decoherence is known as the "flip-flop" process, where two interacting spins interchange their quantum state. Currently, for electron spins, the rate of this process can only be estimated theoretically, or measured indirectly, under limiting assumptions and approximations, via spin-relaxation data. This work experimentally demonstrates how the flip-flop rate can be directly and accurately measured by examining spin-diffusion processes in the solid state for physically fixed spins. Under such terms, diffusion can occur only through this flip-flop-mediated quantum-state exchange and not via actual spatial motion. Our approach is implemented on two types of samples, phosphorus-doped Si28 and nitrogen vacancies in diamond, both of which are significantly relevant to quantum sensors and information processing. However, while the results for the former sample are conclusive and reveal a flip-flop rate of approximately 12.3 Hz, for the latter sample only an upper limit of approximately 0.2 Hz for this rate can be estimated.},

Two Stark effects are resolved: a decrease of the hyperfine coupling between electron and nuclear spins of the donor and a decrease in electron Zeeman g-factor. The hyperfine term prevails at X-band magnetic fields of 0.35T, while the g-factor term is expected to dominate at higher magnetic fields. A significant linear Stark effect is also resolved presumably arising from strain.},

abstract = {Entanglement is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum mechanics 1–3 , and is the key resource for quantum information processing 4,5 (QIP). Bipartite entangled states of identical particles have been generated and studied in several experiments, and post-selected or heralded entangled states involving pairs of photons, single photons and single atoms, or different nuclei in the solid state, have also been produced 6–12 . Here we use a deterministic quantum logic gate to generate a 'hybrid' entangled state of two trapped-ion qubits held in different isotopes of calcium, perform full tomography of the state produced, and make a test of Bell's inequality with non-identical atoms. We use a laser-driven two-qubit gate 13 , whose mechanism is insensitive to the qubits' energy splittings, to produce a maximally entangled state of one 40 Ca + qubit and one 43 Ca + qubit, held 3.5 micrometres apart in the same ion trap, with 99.8 ± 0.6 per cent fidelity. We test the CHSH (Clauser– Horne–Shimony–Holt) 14 version of Bell's inequality for this novel entangled state and find that it is violated by 15 standard deviations; in this test, we close the detection loophole 8 but not the locality loophole 7 . Mixed-species quantum logic is a powerful technique for the construction of a quantum computer based on trapped ions, as it allows protection of memory qubits while other qubits undergo logic operations or are used as photonic interfaces to other processing units 15,16 . The entangling gate mechanism used here can also be applied to qubits stored in different atomic elements; this would allow both memory and logic gate errors caused by photon scattering to be reduced below the levels required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, which is an essential prerequisite for general-purpose quantum computing. For Schr{\"{o}}dinger, entanglement was " the characteristic trait of quan-tum mechanics " 1},

This exchange process is expected to let the system at low temperatures escape from a local minimum. By using this algorithm the three-dimensional +/-J Ising spin glass model is studied. The ergodicity time in this method is found much smaller than that of the multi-canonical method. In particular the time correlation function almost follows an exponential decay whose relaxation time is comparable to the ergodicity time at low temperatures. It suggests that the system relaxes very rapidly through the exchange process even in the low temperature phase.},

abstract = {Electrical detection of spins is an essential tool in understanding the dynamics of spins in semiconductor devices, providing valuable insights for applications ranging from optoelectronics and spintronics to quantum information processing. For electron spins bound to shallow donors in silicon, bulk electrically-detected magnetic resonance has relied on coupling to spin readout partners such as paramagnetic defects or conduction electrons which fundamentally limits spin coherence times. Here we demonstrate electrical detection of phosphorus donor electron spin resonance by transport through a silicon device, using optically-driven donor-bound exciton transitions. We use this method to measure electron spin Rabi oscillations, and, by avoiding use of an ancillary spin for readout, we are able to obtain long intrinsic electron spin coherence times, limited only by the donor concentration. We go on to experimentally address critical issues for adopting this scheme for single spin measurement in silicon nanodevices, including the effects of strain, electric fields, and non-resonant excitation. This lays the foundations for realising a versatile readout method for single spin readout with relaxed magnetic field and temperature requirements compared with spin-dependent tunneling.},

Atoms have been successfully used to store and process quantum information in electromagnetic traps, as well as in diamond through the use of the nitrogen-vacancy-centre point defect. Solid-state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger-scale quantum processors. Coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in lithographically defined double quantum dots in both GaAs (refs 3-5) and Si (ref. 6). However, it is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent in atomic spin qubits. Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot read-out. We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, and a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time exceeding 200 µs. This time should be even longer in isotopically enriched (28)Si samples. Combined with a device architecture that is compatible with modern integrated circuit technology, the electron spin of a single phosphorus atom in silicon should be an excellent platform on which to build a scalable quantum computer.},

We next describe how logical qubits are formed in the surface code array and give numerical estimates of their fault-tolerance. We outline how logical qubits are physically moved on the array, how qubit braid transformations are constructed, and how a braid between two logical qubits is equivalent to a controlled-NOT. We then describe the single-qubit Hadamard, S and T operators, completing the set of required gates for a universal quantum computer. We conclude by briefly discussing physical implementations of the surface code. We include a number of appendices in which we provide supplementary information to the main text.},

@article{Tyagi1983,
abstract = {A review of our present understanding about the minority carrier recombination in silicon with dopant concentration in the range of 1018-1020 cm-3 is presented. After providing a short phenomenological description of carrier recombination processes and lifetime, the main theories of carrier recombination in a semiconductor are briefly reviewed and their expected contributions to carrier recombination in silicon at heavy doping are indicated. The various methods used for measuring the minority carrier lifetime in heavily doped silicon are described and critically examined. Four different mechanisms are examined to explain the available lifetime data. Two of these involve SRH-type phononic recombination (i) via deep level traps generated by dopant introduced defects and (ii) through shallow donor/acceptor states. The other two non-phononic mechanisms are: (iii) Band to band Auger recombination and (iv) trap assisted Auger recombination. Mechanism (i) can not explain the observed insensitivity of lifetime to processing conditions and the dopant atoms, and contribution of (ii) remains insignificant up to the heaviest doping. Phonon assisted band to band Auger recombination appears to explain the measured lifetimes satisfactorily in p-type silicon. However, for n-type silicon this mechanism predicts considerably higher values of lifetime than the measured results and it is likely that mechanism (iv) (and probably (i) also) competes with this process. Calculations indicate that the rate of trap-assisted Auger recombination through the dopant generated acceptor states in p-type silicon and through donor states in n-type silicon becomes large enough to compete with the band to band Auger process at heavy doping. In n-type silicon Auger recombination through crystal defects like vacancies may also become important. Perhaps all these processes contribute to the carrier recombination at heavy doping but which of these controls the lifetime in n-type silicon is not known. ?? 1983.},

Unlike classical bits that are subject to only digital bit-flip errors, quantum bits are susceptible to a much larger spectrum of errors, for which any complete quantum error-correcting code must account. Whilst classical bit-flip detection can be realized via a linear array of qubits, a general fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting code requires extending into a higher-dimensional lattice. Here we present a quantum error detection protocol on a two-by-two planar lattice of superconducting qubits. The protocol detects an arbitrary quantum error on an encoded two-qubit entangled state via quantum non-demolition parity measurements on another pair of error syndrome qubits. This result represents a building block towards larger lattices amenable to fault-tolerant quantum error correction architectures such as the surface code.},

abstract = {Machine learning techniques have led to broad adoption of a statistical model of computing. The statistical distributions natively available on quantum processors are a superset of those available classically. Harnessing this attribute has the potential to accelerate or otherwise improve machine learning relative to purely classical performance. A key challenge toward that goal is learning to hybridize classical computing resources and traditional learning techniques with the emerging capabilities of general purpose quantum processors. Here, we demonstrate such hybridization by training a 19-qubit gate model processor to solve a clustering problem, a foundational challenge in unsupervised learning. We use the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in conjunction with a gradient-free Bayesian optimization to train the quantum machine. This quantum/classical hybrid algorithm shows robustness to realistic noise, and we find evidence that classical optimization can be used to train around both coherent and incoherent imperfections.},

abstract = {We study the feasibility of a novel solid-state device engineered from first principles for surface code quantum computing. Quantum information is stored within an array of well-separated impurity spins in a lattice. A second set of `probe' spins are mechanically separate from the data qubits and move in-and-out of their proximity. The spin dipole-dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe's total phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe's path. We introduce a protocol to balance the systematic errors due to the spins being imperfectly located during device construction. Detailed simulations show that the surface code's threshold then corresponds to misalignments that are substantial on the scale of the device, indicating that it is very robust. We conclude that this simple `orbital probe' architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid state computing, while minimising the complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems.},

abstract = {Proposed silicon-based quantum-computer architectures have attracted attention because of their promise for scalability and their potential for synergetically utilizing the available resources associated with the existing Si technology infrastructure. Electronic and nuclear spins of shallow donors (e.g. phosphorus) in Si are ideal candidates for qubits in such proposals because of their long spin coherence times due to their limited interactions with their environments. For these spin qubits, shallow donor exchange gates are frequently invoked to perform two-qubit operations. We discuss in this review a particularly important spin decoherence channel, and bandstructure effects on the exchange gate control. Specifically, we review our work on donor electron spin spectral diffusion due to background nuclear spin flip-flops, and how isotopic purification of silicon can significantly enhance the electron spin dephasing time. We then review our calculation of donor electron exchange coupling in the presence of degenerate silicon conduction band valleys. We show that valley interference leads to orders of magnitude variations in electron exchange coupling when donor configurations are changed on an atomic scale. These studies illustrate the substantial potential that donor electron/nuclear spins in silicon have as candidates for qubits and simultaneously the considerable challenges they pose. In particular, our work on spin decoherence through spectral diffusion points to the possible importance of isotopic purification in the fabrication of scalable solid state quantum computer architectures. We also provide a critical comparison between the two main proposed spin-based solid state quantum computer architectures, namely, shallow donor bound states in Si and localized quantum dot states in GaAs. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The calculation includes both the first-order or direct processes important at low temperatures, and the second-order or "Raman" type of term predominant in the liquid-air region. There is no difficulty in understanding the observed absence of dispersion in titanium alum at liquid-air temperatures, but, barring crystal imperfections, it is hard to understand this absence at helium temperatures unless the nearest excited states are unreasonably deep. The agreement between the orders of magnitude of the calculated and experimental relaxation times is adequate in chromium both at high and low temperatures. The calculations predict, in agreement with experiments, that at liquid-air temperatures the relaxation time should increase when a constant field H0 is applied and should be independent of the direction of H0. The computed increase, however, is apparently not great enough. At helium temperatures, $\tau$ is theoretically not quite isotropic, and d$\tau$/dH0 has the wrong sign, unless one abandons the usual formula $\rho$$\omega$∼$\omega$2 for the density of lattice oscillators. The calculations on chromium should also apply qualitatively to iron alum, discussed at the very end.},

abstract = {A theory of the ‘bottleneck‘ which restricts relaxation by the Orbach mechanism when too few phonons of the appropriate frequencies are available is developed for the case of a spin doublet relaxing via a single excited level. The extent to which the relaxation disturbs the distribution of phonons is found on the assumption that the only broadehing of the two bands of lattice modes concerned is that associated with the finite lifetime of the excited spin level. The relaxation is hindered most when the splitting of the doublet in an applied magnetic field His such that the bands are well separated. Otherwise overlap between them reduces the effect of the bottleneck, so that it disappears as H approaches zero. It is predicted that in certain conditions there will be a range of H and of paramagnetic concentration c in which the relaxation time is proportional to H{\^{}}1/2c{\^{}}1/4. A comparison with the few experimental data at present available provides some support for the theory. It is noteworthy that the magnitudes of the observed relaxation times are consistent with phonon lifetimes of the order of 10{\^{}}-6 s and limited by escape through the crystal surface.},

Typically it is assumed that the links between modules are prone to noise while operations within modules have significantly higher fidelity. To optimise fault tolerance in such architectures we introduce a hierarchical generalisation of the surface code: a small `patch' of the code exists within each module, and constitutes a single effective qubit of the logic-level surface code. Errors primarily occur in a two-dimensional subspace, i.e. patch perimeters extruded over time, and the resulting noise threshold for inter-module links can exceed {\~{}} 10{\%} even in the absence of purification. Increasing the number of qubits within each module decreases the number of qubits necessary for encoding a logical qubit. But this advantage is relatively modest, and broadly speaking a `fine grained' network of small modules containing only {\~{}} 8 qubits is competitive in total qubit count versus a `course' network with modules containing many hundreds of qubits.},

A multi-valley effective mass theory, dealing non-perturbatively with valley-orbit interactions induced by a donor-dependent central cell potential, allows us to obtain a very reliable picture of the donor wave function within a relatively simple framework. Variational optimization of the 1s donor binding energies calculated with a new trial wave function, in a pseudopotential with two fitting parameters, allows an accurate match of the experimentally determined donor energy levels, while the correct limiting behavior for the electronic density, both close to and far from each impurity nucleus, is captured by fitting the measured contact hyperfine coupling between the donor nuclear and electron spin. We go on to include an external uniform electric field in order to model Stark physics: With no extra ad hoc parameters, variational minimization of the complete donor ground energy allows a quantitative description of the field-induced reduction of electronic density at each impurity nucleus. Detailed comparisons with experimental values for the shifts of the contact hyperfine coupling reveal very close agreement for all the donors measured (P, As, Sb and Bi). Finally, we estimate field ionization thresholds for the donor ground states, thus setting upper limits to the gate manipulation times for single qubit operations in Kane-like architectures: the Si:Bi system is shown to allow for A gates as fast as around 10 MHz.},

Leveraging ideas from the literature on distributed computation together with the recent work on probabilistic cluster state synthesis, our model assigns to each physical system two logical qubits: the broker and the client. Groups of brokers negotiate new graph state fragments via a probabilistic optical protocol. Completed fragments are mapped from broker to clients via a simple state transition and measurement. The clients, whose role is to store the nascent graph state long term, remain entirely insulated from failures during the brokerage. We describe an implementation in terms of NV-centres in diamond, where brokers and clients are very naturally embodied as electron and nuclear spins.},

abstract = {Quantum entanglement between spatially separated objects is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physics. The outcomes of independent measurements on entangled objects show correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics. As well as being of fundamental interest, entanglement is a unique resource for quantum information processing and communication. Entangled quantum bits (qubits) can be used to share private information or implement quantum logical gates. Such capabilities are particularly useful when the entangled qubits are spatially separated, providing the opportunity to create highly connected quantum networks or extend quantum cryptography to long distances. Here we report entanglement of two electron spin qubits in diamond with a spatial separation of three metres. We establish this entanglement using a robust protocol based on creation of spin–photon entanglement at each location and a subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of the photons heralds the projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state. We verify the resulting non-local quantum correlations by performing single-shot readout on the qubits in different bases. The long-distance entanglement reported here can be combined with recently achieved initialization, readout and entanglement operations on local long-lived nuclear spin registers, paving the way for deterministic long-distance teleportation, quantum repeaters and extended quantum networks.},

Nonetheless, a mechanism for high-fidelity spin-to-photon conversation, which is a crucial prerequisite for such technologies, has not yet been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate a high-fidelity spin-to-photon interface in isolated divacancies in epitaxial films of 3C-SiC and 4H-SiC. Our data show that divacancies in 4H-SiC have minimal undesirable spin-mixing, and that the optical linewidths in our current sample are already similar to those of recent remote entanglement demonstrations in other systems. Moreover, we find that 3C-SiC divacancies have millisecond Hahn-echo spin coherence time, which is among the longest measured in a naturally isotopic solid. The presence of defects with these properties in a commercial semiconductor that can be heteroepitaxially grown as a thin film on shows promise for future quantum networks based on SiC defects.},

abstract = {Optically linked ion traps are promising as components of network-based quantum technologies, including communication systems and modular computers. Experimental results achieved to date indicate that the fidelity of operations within each ion trap module will be far higher than the fidelity of operations involving the links; fortunately internal storage and processing can effectively upgrade the links through the process of purification. Here we perform the most detailed analysis to date on this purification task, using a protocol which is balanced to maximise fidelity while minimising the device complexity and the time cost of the process. Moreover we 'compile down' the quantum circuit to device-level operations including cooling and shutting events. We find that a linear trap with only five ions (two of one species, three of another) can support our protocol while incorporating desirable features such as global control, i.e. laser control pulses need only target an entire zone rather than differentiating one ion from its neighbour. To evaluate the capabilities of such a module we consider its use both as a universal communications node for quantum key distribution, and as the basic repeating unit of a quantum computer. For the latter case we evaluate the threshold for fault tolerant quantum computing using the surface code, finding acceptable fidelities for the 'raw' entangling link as low as 83{\%} (or under 75{\%} if an additional ion is available).},

abstract = {Electronic spins in semiconductors have been used extensively to explore the limits of external control over quantum mechanical phenomena. A long-standing goal of this research has been to identify or develop robust quantum systems that can be easily manipulated, for future use in advanced information and communication technologies. Recently, a point defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy centre has attracted a great deal of interest because it possesses an atomic-scale electronic spin state that can be used as an individually addressable, solid-state quantum bit (qubit), even at room temperature. These exceptional quantum properties have motivated efforts to identify similar defects in other semiconductors, as they may offer an expanded range of functionality not available to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. Notably, several defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have been suggested as good candidates for exploration, owing to a combination of computational predictions and magnetic resonance data. Here we demonstrate that several defect spin states in the 4H polytype of SiC (4H-SiC) can be optically addressed and coherently controlled in the time domain at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 kelvin. Using optical and microwave techniques similar to those used with diamond nitrogen-vacancy qubits, we study the spin-1 ground state of each of four inequivalent forms of the neutral carbon-silicon divacancy, as well as a pair of defect spin states of unidentified origin. These defects are optically active near telecommunication wavelengths, and are found in a host material for which there already exist industrial-scale crystal growth and advanced microfabrication techniques. In addition, they possess desirable spin coherence properties that are comparable to those of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. This makes them promising candidates for various photonic, spintronic and quantum information applications that merge quantum degrees of freedom with classical electronic and optical technologies.},

This is particularly important in nanodevices where the proximity of material interfaces, and their associated defects, can play a limiting role. Spin decoherence can be addressed to varying degrees by improving material purity or isotopic composition, for example, or active error correction methods such as dynamic decoupling (or even combinations of the two). However, a powerful method applied to trapped ions in the context of atomic clocks is the use of particular spin transitions that are inherently robust to external perturbations. Here, we show that such 'clock transitions' can be observed for electron spins in the solid state, in particular using bismuth donors in silicon. This leads to dramatic enhancements in the electron spin coherence time, exceeding seconds. We find that electron spin qubits based on clock transitions become less sensitive to the local magnetic environment, including the presence of (29)Si nuclear spins as found in natural silicon. We expect the use of such clock transitions will be of additional significance for donor spins in nanodevices, mitigating the effects of magnetic or electric field noise arising from nearby interfaces and gates.},

Our scheme uses a quantum coprocessor to efficiently solve a linear impurity problem with parameters iterated to self-consistency via a feedback loop evaluated on a classical computer. The required quantum resources scale linearly with the simulated time while known classical algorithms scale exponentially. Quantum gate errors can partly be accounted for in the classical feedback loop improving the simulation results.

abstract = {Quantum annealing (QA) has been proposed as a quantum enhanced optimization heuristic exploiting tunneling. Here, we demonstrate how finite range tunneling can provide considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating local minima, the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to Simulated Annealing (SA). For instances with 945 variables this results in a time-to-99$\backslash${\%}-success-probability that is {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}8{\$} times faster than SA running on a single processor core. We also compared physical QA with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical QA: D-Wave 2X runs up to {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}8{\$} times faster than an optimized implementation of QMC on a single core. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be represented on quantum hardware. For random instances of the number partitioning problem, we find numerically that QMC, as well as other algorithms designed to simulate QA, scale better than SA and better than the best known classical algorithms for this problem. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next generation quantum annealers.},

Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10{\^{}}6 qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}, would be a formidable factoring engine.

abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) colour centre in diamond is an important physical system for emergent quantum technologies, including quantum metrology, information processing and communications, as well as for various nanotechnologies, such as biological and sub-diffraction limit imaging, and for tests of entanglement in quantum mechanics. Given this array of existing and potential applications and the almost 50 years of NV research, one would expect that the physics of the centre is well understood, however, the study of the NV centre has proved challenging, with many early assertions now believed false and many remaining issues yet to be resolved. This review represents the first time that the key empirical and ab initio results have been extracted from the extensive NV literature and assembled into one consistent picture of the current understanding of the centre. As a result, the key unresolved issues concerning the NV centre are identified and the possible avenues for their resolution are examined. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Quantum communication holds promise for absolutely secure transmission of secret messages and the faithful transfer of unknown quantum states. Photonic channels appear to be very attractive for the physical implementation of quantum communication. However, owing to losses and decoherence in the channel, the communication fidelity decreases exponentially with the channel length. Here we describe a scheme that allows the implementation of robust quantum communication over long lossy channels. The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic ensembles, beam splitters, and single-photon detectors with moderate efficiencies, and is therefore compatible with current experimental technology. We show that the communication efficiency scales polynomially with the channel length, and hence the scheme should be operable over very long distances.},

abstract = {We devise a simple modification that essentially doubles the efficiency of the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme proposed by Bennett and Brassard. We also prove the security of our modified scheme against the most general eavesdropping attack that is allowed by the laws of physics. The first major ingredient of our scheme is the assignment of significantly different probabilities to the different polarization bases during both transmission and reception, thus reducing the fraction of discarded data. A second major ingredient of our scheme is a refined analysis of accepted data: We divide the accepted data into various subsets according to the basis employed and estimate an error rate for each subset *separately*. We then show that such a refined data analysis guarantees the security of our scheme against the most general eavesdropping strategy, thus generalizing Shor and Preskill's proof of security of BB84 to our new scheme. Up till now, most proposed proofs of security of single-particle type quantum key distribution schemes have relied heavily upon the fact that the bases are chosen uniformly, randomly and independently. Our proof removes this symmetry requirement.},

Traditional machine learning has dramatically improved the benchmarking and control of experimental quantum computing systems, including adaptive quantum phase estimation and designing quantum computing gates. On the other hand, quantum mechanics offers tantalizing prospects to enhance machine learning, ranging from reduced computational complexity to improved generalization performance. The most notable examples include quantum enhanced algorithms for principal component analysis, quantum support vector machines, and quantum Boltzmann machines. Progress has been rapid, fostered by demonstrations of midsized quantum optimizers which are predicted to soon outperform their classical counterparts. Further, we are witnessing the emergence of a physical theory pinpointing the fundamental and natural limitations of learning.

abstract = {The exchange of energy between a system of nuclear spins immersed in a strong magnetic 6eld, and the heat reservoir consisting of the other degrees of freedom {\{}the "lattice" ) of the substance containing the magnetic nuclei, serves to bring the spin system into equibbrium at a 6nite tempera- ture. In this condition the system can absorb energy from an applied radiofrequency 6eld. With the absorption of energy, however, the spin temperature tends to rise and the rate of absorption to decrease. Through this "satura- tion" effect, and in some cases by a more direct method, the spin-lettre relaxation time Ti can be measured. The interaction among the magnetic nuclei, with which a characteristic time Tg' is associated, contributes to the width of the absorption line. Both interactions have been studied in a variety of substances, but with the emphasis on liquids containing hydrogen. Magnetic resonance absorption is observed by means of a radiofrequenqy bridge; the magnetic field at the sample is modulated at a low frequency. A detailed analysis of the method by which T{\~{}} is derived from saturation experiments is given. Relaxation times observed range from 10 4 to 10' seconds. In liquids T{\&} ordinarily decreases with increasing viscosity, in some cases reaching a mini- mum value after which it increases with further increase in viscosity. The line width meanwhile increases mono- tonically from an extremely small value toward a value determined by the spin-spin interaction in the rigid lattice.}},

Many of the multiobjective test problems employed in the EA literature have not been rigorously analyzed, which makes it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms tested on them. In this paper, we systematically review and analyze many problems from the EA literature, each belonging to the important class of real-valued, unconstrained, multiobjective test problems. To support this, we first introduce a set of test problem criteria, which are in turn supported by a set of definitions. Our analysis of test problems highlights a number of areas requiring attention. Not only are many test problems poorly constructed but also the important class of nonseparable problems, particularly nonseparable multimodal problems, is poorly represented. Motivated by these findings, we present a flexible toolkit for constructing well-designed test problems. We also present empirical results demonstrating how the toolkit can be used to test an optimizer in ways that existing test suites do not},

abstract = {Long coherence times are key to the performance of quantum bits (qubits). Here, we experimentally and theoretically show that the Hahn-echo coherence time (T2) of electron spins associated with divacancy defects in 4H-SiC reaches 1.3 ms, one of the longest T2 times of an electron spin in a naturally isotopic crystal. Using a first-principles microscopic quantum-bath model, we find that two factors determine the unusually robust coherence. First, in the presence of moderate magnetic fields (300 G and above), the 29Si and 13C paramagnetic nuclear spin baths are decoupled. In addition, because SiC is a binary crystal, homo-nuclear spin pairs are both diluted and forbidden from forming strongly coupled, nearest-neighbor spin pairs. Longer neighbor distances result in fewer nuclear spin flip-flops, a less fluctuating intra-crystalline magnetic environment, and thus a longer T2 time. Our results point to polyatomic crystals as promising hosts for coherent qubits in the solid state.},

The bulk lifetime observations are simulated by combining$\backslash$nthe lifetime according to Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) theory with the$\backslash$nlifetime resulting from Auger recombination above a doping concentration$\backslash$nthreshold. It is shown that the bulk carrier lifetime behavior in$\backslash$nSi and Ge is very similar. Carrier lifetime changes in Si can be$\backslash$nwell described by a combined SRH and Auger recombination model, while$\backslash$nlifetime variations in Ge fit well the SRH model, taking into account$\backslash$nthe lifetime dependence on the injection level. It is shown that$\backslash$nthe lifetime dependence on dopant concentration in germanium can$\backslash$nbe phenomenologically described by assuming a linear increase of$\backslash$nrecombination center concentration with dopant concentration. The$\backslash$nresults also illustrate the importance of surface passivation and$\backslash$nof material quality which depends on the fabrication technology,$\backslash$nwhen comparing carrier lifetimes obtained with different equipment$\backslash$nand on different samples.

abstract = {A spin-Hamiltonian approach to the theory of spin-lattice relaxation in paramagnetic salts is developed in which the orbit-lattice interaction is treated as a perturbation connecting states of the overall spin-Hamiltonian. The approach is much simpler than previous treatments where the spin-orbit and Zeeman effects were treated as perturbations. and is appliciable to a wide range of salts including both the iron group and the rare earth group. It is found that, for Kramers salts (ions with an odd number of electrons), many previous results apply quite generally, regardless of the relative size of the spin-orbit and crystalline field terms, buut there are important exceptations. For the case of large crystalline field splitting, the relaxation rate (inverse of the relaxation time T1) varsus as H{\^{}}4T and T{\^{}}9 for direct and Raman process respectively, as van Vleck has previously shown. The so-called Van Vleck cancellation leading to these dependence is dirived in a very simple and quite general manner. For small crystal field splittings $\Delta$, less than, or of the order of, the lattice Debye temperature, the relaxation rate varies as H-4T and aexp(-$\Delta$/kT)+bT{\^{}}9 for direct and Raman processes prspectively. The two coefficients a and b are such that the T{\^{}}9 term is important only at low temperatures where the exponential term is quite small. These results are in marked contrast with earlier theories.},

In this paper we discuss traditional and novel methods for its experimental determination. Among the latter, the Quasi-steady-state photoconductance is particularly powerful since it permits measuring the injection level dependence of the lifetime. The analysis and interpretation of this dependence yields a wealth of information on the physical mechanisms that limit the performance of silicon solar cells. The effect of the surfaces of the silicon wafers, the emitter saturation current density and the Shockley-Read-Hall and Auger recombination mechanisms are explained and their possible determination from lifetime measurements discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We give a quantum algorithm for solving instances of the satisfiability problem, based on adiabatic evolution. The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

abstract = {Electronic spins in semiconductors have been used extensively to explore the limits of external control over quantum mechanical phenomena. A long-standing goal of this research has been to identify or develop robust quantum systems that can be easily manipulated, for future use in advanced information and communication technologies. Recently, a point defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy centre has attracted a great deal of interest because it possesses an atomic-scale electronic spin state that can be used as an individually addressable, solid-state quantum bit (qubit), even at room temperature. These exceptional quantum properties have motivated efforts to identify similar defects in other semiconductors, as they may offer an expanded range of functionality not available to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. Notably, several defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have been suggested as good candidates for exploration, owing to a combination of computational predictions and magnetic resonance data. Here we demonstrate that several defect spin states in the 4H polytype of SiC (4H-SiC) can be optically addressed and coherently controlled in the time domain at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 kelvin. Using optical and microwave techniques similar to those used with diamond nitrogen-vacancy qubits, we study the spin-1 ground state of each of four inequivalent forms of the neutral carbon-silicon divacancy, as well as a pair of defect spin states of unidentified origin. These defects are optically active near telecommunication wavelengths, and are found in a host material for which there already exist industrial-scale crystal growth and advanced microfabrication techniques. In addition, they possess desirable spin coherence properties that are comparable to those of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. This makes them promising candidates for various photonic, spintronic and quantum information applications that merge quantum degrees of freedom with classical electronic and optical technologies.},

abstract = {By using the recently measured effective masses for n-type Si, m1=0.98 m and m2=0.19 m, approximate solutions of the resulting effective mass Schroedinger equation are obtained. The accuracy of the solutions was tested in the limiting cases where m2/m1 = 1 and 0 respectively. The nature of the resulting states and their degeneracy is discussed in some detail, taking into account the fact that the conduction band of the Si has six equivalent minima. Experimentally measured ionization energies show that the effective mass theory is seriously in error in the case of the ground state. This error is attributed to the failure of the effective mass theory near the donor nucleus, and allowance for this failure is made in the case of higher states. This leads finally to a theoretical spectrum for the electrons bound by P, As, or Sb donors.},

abstract = {Recently, it was realized that use of the properties of quantum mechanics might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest in quantum computation has since been growing. One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t){\^{}}c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},
