\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{chap:litRev}

Having introduced the background theory to the work discussed in this report, I turn to a more detailed examination of the literature surrounding it.
I begin with the various relaxation and decoherence processes for spins bound to donors in silicon.
First discussing the mechanisms by which these processes occur I shall then move on to the effect of illumination on these mechanisms.
Following this I shall move on the the stark shift of donor spins in silicon, including a brief introduction to the principle before an examination of previous work performed to characterise this effect in the various species of donor in silicon.


\section{Mechanisms of Relaxation and Decoherence}
\label{sec:mechrelax}
The concept of $T_1, T_2$ and $T_2^*$ time was introduced in section \ref{sec:relProc} as the characteristic relaxation, decoherence and dephasing times respectively. 
I shall now focus on the established mechanisms by which these occur, looking mainly at relaxation and decoherence as these represent a permanent loss of information.

\subsection{Relaxation}

The relaxation time, $T_1$, determines the rate at which the polarisation of an ensemble of spins returns to Boltzmann equilibrium after being disturbed.
The first method of relaxation that should be considered is spontaneous emission: the emission of a photon into free space as the spin relaxes from excited to ground state. 
For a magnetic dipole this rate is slow in normal circumstances - thousands of seconds or more \cite{schweiger2001principles,Baranov2017}. 
Given that above millikelvin temperatures the rate of transverse relaxation for donor spins in silicon is significantly greater than this it can be neglected as a dominant mechanism.
\\
Spin-lattice relaxation occurs instead via the interaction with of the spin system with vibrations in the silicon lattice - phonons. 
There are three different phonon-mediated processes that affect the relaxation rate of spin systems with transition frequency $\omega_s$, all of which are well described in a 1961 paper by Orbach \cite{VanVleck1940,Orbach1961}.
\\
\\
\textbf{Direct Process}
\\
\noindent\rule{\columnwidth}{1pt}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5cm}{}
The first of these is a \textbf{direct process}, whereby a single phonon with frequency equal to that of the spin transition (as given by equation \ref{eq:spinHam}) is emitted into the lattice. 
This rate ($\propto 1/T_1$) is proportional to the phonon density at $\omega_s$ and varies with spin transition frequency and temperature as: $\omega_s^{-4}T^{-1}$.
\\
\end{adjustwidth}
\textbf{Raman Process}
\par\noindent\rule{\columnwidth}{1pt}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5cm}{}
Whilst this rate dominates at lower temperatures, $<10$k, at temperatures with $k_BT \gg \hslash\omega_s$, a two phonon Raman transition becomes more efficient.
As the maximum phonon density is at much higher frequencies than $\omega_s$, the spin first absorbs a phonon at $\omega_{\text{max}}$ before emitting a phonon with $\omega = \omega_{\text{max}} + \omega_s$. 
This corresponds to the spin transitioning to a virtual energy level before rapidly transitioning back to the spin ground state.
For non-integer spin systems the rate due to this effect scales with temperature as: $T^{7}$.
\\
\end{adjustwidth}
\textbf{Orbach Process}
\\
\noindent\rule{\columnwidth}{1pt}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5cm}{}
The Raman process involves a virtual energy level so is an inherently off-resonant effect. 
It is possible for the spin to transition to an actual excited state during the two phonon process. 
This is known as an Orbach process and is more efficient than either process above. 
It scales with temperature as: $\exp\left({-\Delta E/K_BT}\right)-1$.
\\
\end{adjustwidth}

\subsection{Decoherence}
\label{sec:litdecoherence}

At high temperatures the spin-lattice relaxation rate tends to be the dominant process for spins in silicon.
However, at temperatures below $\approx 10$k other factors become limiting. 
In particular the decoherence or $T_2$ time becomes important. 
This is the process by which the spins lose phase coherence irreversibly. 
There are several mechanisms that contribute to $T_2$, detailed here.
\\
\\
\textbf{Spectral Diffusion}
\\
\noindent\rule{\columnwidth}{1pt}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5cm}{}
The first of these is spectral diffusion and its impact is largely dependent on the sample used.
In natural silicon samples there is a relatively high concentration of Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $^{29}$Si nuclear spins ($4.7\%$). 
Due to the large extent of the donor electron wavefunction, it is highly probable that a given donor will experience a hyperfine interaction with one or more of these nuclei.
Although the large difference between the electron and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios prevents a state exchange or `flip-flop' interaction, nearby pairs of $^{29}$Si nuclei do have this interaction.
The rate of exchange is slow, ($\approx 100$Hz) and will cause a change in the hyperfine interaction with any nearby donor electrons.
This will cause the acquisition of phase differences between electrons over time.
As these changes are time dependent they are \textit{not} refocused by a Hahn echo sequence \cite{Wolfowicz2015a}. 
In purified silicon samples this effect is reduced to the point that it is no longer the limiting factor in spin coherence.
\\
\end{adjustwidth}
\textbf{Instantaneous Diffusion}
\\
\noindent\rule{\columnwidth}{1pt}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5cm}{}
In the first experiments on spin coherence times on purified silicon, the increase in coherence time was found to be on the order 2 fold \cite{Gordon1958}.
The reason behind this limited increase was the high donor concentrations, leading to interaction between donors.
Spins that are close enough to interact with one another will experience slightly different magnetic fields and the random nature of donor distribution leads to this effect being inhomogeneous.
Once again, this will not be reversed by a Hahn echo sequence as two donors interacting with one another will both be flipped, meaning that the phase acquisition is unchanged.
This effect is dependent on the concentration of donors in a sample according to:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{T_{2}^{\text{ID}}} = C(2\pi\gamma_e)^2\frac{\pi}{9\sqrt{3}}\mu_0\hslash,
\label{eq:instDiff}
\end{equation}

where C is the donor concentration.
\\
\end{adjustwidth}
At concentrations useful for ESR techniques and at sufficiently low temperatures instantaneous diffusion will be a limiting factor in spin coherence times in almost all cases.
One technique employed by Tyryshkin \textit{et al}, open to ensemble based approaches such as ESR but not to single qubit control, is to use refocussing pulses of angle $<\pi$ in the Hahn echo sequence \cite{Tyryshkin2011}.
This effectively refocuses fewer spins during the Hahn echo sequence. 
This reduces the signal but increases $T_2$ time as the effect of instantaneous diffusion is suppressed by addressed spins being on average much further apart. 
At this point three further effects become limiting:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Direct $T_1$ Flips}: only relevant at higher temperatures when $T_1$ is close to the intrinsic $T_2$, $>10$k. This is the process of a single donor flipping to its ground state, thereby destroying its coherence.
\item \textit{Spectral Diffusion from donors}: the limiting factor at low temperatures $<4$k, this process is similar to the spectral diffusion for $^{29}$Si spins. Nearby pairs of donors undergo spin exchange, causing any other nearby donors to experience a phase shift as their hyperfine coupling changes. 
\item \textit{$T_1$ of Neighbouring Donors}: this process is important at intermediate temperatures, between $4$k and $10$k. At these temperatures direct $T_1$ flips are yet to dominate but $T_1$ flips of neighbouring donors can affect the magnetic field experienced by a central donor. This effect is known as $T_1$-type spectral diffusion.
This process was identified by Tyryshkin \textit{et al} as producing shorter than expected $T_2$ times when $T_1$ appeared to no longer be a limiting factor \cite{Tyryshkin2011}. 
The decoherence rate as a function of $T_1$ induced spectral diffusion has a characteristic, stretched exponential of the form $\exp(-(2\tau/T_{SD})^2)$, with $T_2^{SD} = \sqrt[]{T_1}$.
\end{itemize}

The five key contributors to decoherence are shown in figure \ref{fig:decoherenceTypes}.
The key contributors to decoherence times are then:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Temperature}: when $T_1$ is sufficiently short at high temperatures the $T_1$ of the donors will restrict $T_2$. At intermediate temperatures $T_1$ flips of neighbouring donors induces spectral diffusion, reducing $T_2$.
\item \textit{Sample Purity}: the concentration of $^{29}$Si spins in the silicon has a significant impact on $T_2$ due to spectral diffusion via nuclear spin flip-flop.
\item \textit{Donor Concentration}: the concentration of donors increases the rate of instantaneous diffusion, indirect flip-flop, direct flip-flop and $T_1$ type spectral diffusion. 
\end{itemize}

With the mechanisms of decoherence addressed, I now turn to examine the effect of illumination on donor relaxation and coherence rates.

\end{figure}



\section{Illumination and Decoherence}

\subsection{Free Carriers and Decoherence}

The discussion above centred on the typical factors that affect coherence and relaxation times:  temperature, donor concentration and silicon purity.
One of the key questions addressed in this report is the impact of another factor on relaxation times: illumination.
Feher and Gere were among the first to examine this impact in their 1959 paper \cite{Gere1959}, analysed using CW ESR of phosphorus donors in silicon. 
The key question that they examined is the impact of illumination wavelength on relaxation time, the results of which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:phosPhotFeher}. 
The important result here is the sharp increase in relaxation rate as the photon energies exceed that of the silicon band gap, $\approx 1.12$eV.
As this energy is exceeded by the photons, free carriers are created in the silicon conduction band as electrons are promoted from the valence band.
These free carriers can scatter off the electrons bound to the phosphorus donors, causing them to relax via a state exchange.
Feher and Gere postulate two possible processes that could cause this relaxation: the first is direct scattering of a donor electron by a free electron, whilst the second is a two stage process.
They identify the second of these as dominant, due in the main to the low number of free electrons relative to donors in their experiments - $5\times10^6$ vs $7\times10^{15}$ - with each interaction requiring the subsequent relaxation of the conduction electron to the lattice.
The double spin exchange process does not involve the free electron changing spin, instead both the nuclear spin of the donor and the electron bound to it change spin state. 
This removes the requirement that the conduction electron subsequently relax to the valence band, significantly increasing the rate of the process.
\\

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.75\columnwidth]{Figures/photEngDep.pdf}
\caption[$T_1$ dependence on photon energy]{Graph from \cite{Gere1959} showing the measured dependence of relaxation time on photon energy. Notable is the sharp increase in relaxation rate for photon energies in excess of 1.10~eV. The main cause of this is that this is the energy of the photon band gap, meaning that free electrons are created in the silicon conduction band. These free electrons can then scatter off the electrons bound to donors in silicon, causing them to relax.}
\label{fig:phosPhotFeher}
\end{figure}

The work done by Feher and Gere was performed using only CW ESR, because of this their work addresses only the impact of laser illumination on $T_1$. 
The key timescale for quantum computing is the coherence time, $T_2$, which must be examined using pulsed ESR.
Whilst $T_2$ time will ultimately be limited by $T_1$ a concern is that free carriers in the silicon conduction band will have an impact beyond this.
It seems obvious that the presence of these free carriers could alter the magnetic environment of the donors in a time-dependent and inhomogeneous fashion, potentially having a drastic impact on the coherence time of donors.
Examining the impact of illumination on decoherence times will be an important goal of this report.

\subsection{Heating and Decoherence}

A potential factor not addressed by Feher and Gere is the impact that heating could have on relaxation and by extension coherence times. 
Although the number of free carriers produced by laser illumination will be significantly reduced as photon energies drop below the band gap, it is possible that heating could still have a significant impact.
Of particular note is the reduced heat capacity of silicon at low temperatures. 
At room temperature heat capacity ($C_p^o$) is 19.1 J.mol$^{-1}$k$^{-1}$, but at cryogenic temperatures this is reduced by several orders of magnitude to approximately 0.004 J.mol$^{-1}$k$^{-1}$ at 8~K \cite{Desai1986,Niinikoski1986}.
Clearly then the potential impact of infra-red illumination is obvious - only a small conversion of incident photons to phonons in the lattice could potentially have a significant impact on the relaxation rates for donor spins.
Exploring this potential impact will be a central goal of this report.
\\
Having looked at some of the literature surrounding the questions of relaxation and decoherence of donors in silicon, I now move on to the stark shift of donors in silicon.

\section{The Stark Shift}
\label{sec:starkShiftLit}

\subsection{Introduction}

The Stark shift, at its simplest, is the modulation of the hyperfine coupling between electron and nuclear spins via electric fields.
The Stark shift was employed in Kane's original proposal as a means to control which qubits interact with an applied control pulse \cite{Kane1998}.
As well as the potential application for control of donor spins, the Stark shift presents a problem in the potential for electric field noise to cause decoherence of donor spins.
This impact may become particularly important for single donors close to electrical contacts where distances are short and so fields high.
Clearly then an understanding of the stark shift and its impact on donors is useful both from control and decoherence perspectives.
\\
An intuitive understanding of the stark shift is easily grasped: the electron's wavefunction extends over space and is concentrated at the donor nucleus. 
This concentration determines the hyperfine coupling of the spin to the donor.
An electric field changes this wavefunction, effectively pulling it off the nucleus and changing the hyperfine coupling, as seen in figure \ref{fig:starkShift}.
This in turn changes the energy difference between the two spin states of the electron and modulates its precession frequency in a static magnetic field.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/starkShift.pdf}
\caption[Electron wavefunction Stark shift]{Simulation showing the density of the electron wavefunction around a donor atom. Red dots represent lattice sites. As an electric field is applied the electron wavefunction is pulled off the central site, changing the strength of its interaction with the donor nucleus and therefore its hyperfine coupling. This shifts the frequency of the electron's spin transition and its precession rate in the magnetic field. Figure reproduced from \cite{Pica2014}.}
\label{fig:starkShift}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Theory}

A technical description of the Stark shift in most cases employs effective mass theory and here I follow the approach taken by Pica \emph{et al} \cite{Pica2014}.
This treats the donor system as if it were a hydrogen atom with a different mass embedded in a silicon lattice as opposed to a vacuum.
This is done by replacing the electron's vacuum mass with its effective mass in the silicon and modifying the vacuum permittivity with the dielectric constant of silicon \cite{Wolfowicz2015a}.
The conduction band of silicon has 6 minima - usually termed 'valleys' - situated in the $\pm x, \pm y, \pm z$ directions and close to the edge of the Brillouin zone, as seen in figure \ref{fig:siliconband}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.75\columnwidth]{Figures/siliconBandStructure.pdf}
\caption[Silicon band structure]{Figure from \cite{Chelikowsky1974}, showing the band structure of silicon. The top of the valence band is at $\Gamma$, the centre of the Brillouin zone, whilst the minimum of the conduction band is at $X$, towards the edge of the zone.}
\label{fig:siliconband}
\end{figure}

The approach of effective mass theory is to decompose the electron wavefunction into six along these conduction band valleys, giving the equation:

\begin{equation}
\psi(r) = \sum_{\text{i}=1}^6{\alpha_\text{i}\phi_\text{i}(r)F_\text{i}(r)},
\end{equation}

here $\phi_\text{i}(r) = u_\text{i} e^{i \bm{k_\text{i}.r}}$, the Bloch wavefunction such that $u_i(r)$ has the periodicity of the lattice and $\bm{k_\text{i}}=k_0\bm{\text{i}}$ with $k_0$ the momentum value at the valley minimum. 
In the electron ground state these valleys are six-fold degenerate, giving the singlet state \cite{Smit2004}:

\begin{equation}
\text{Singlet  } (1sA_{1}) \text{  }
\begin{cases}
\bm{\alpha_g} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This ground state is the only state with a component of the electron wavefunction at the nucleus and therefore the only one that experiences a hyperfine coupling. 
The excited states are as follows:

\begin{equation}
\text{Doublet  } (1sE) \text{  }
\begin{cases}
\bm{\alpha_r} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}(-1, -1, -1, -1, 2, 2)\\
\bm{\alpha_s} = \frac{1}{2}(1, 1, -1, -1, 0, 0)\\
\end{cases}\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{Triplet  } (1sT_2) \text{  } 
\begin{cases}
\bm{\alpha_x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0)\\
\bm{\alpha_y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0)\\
\bm{\alpha_z} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1)\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

When an electric field is applied the symmetry of the valleys is broken leading to the mixing of the various states. 
The states interact via the electric dipole moment $e\bm{E.r}$, allowing estimation of the impact via perturbation theory.
The first order perturbation to the singlet state, $\int\bra{\psi_g(r)}e\bm{E.r}\ket{\psi_g(r)}d\bm{r}$ is zero by symmetry \cite{Pica2014}.
The second order perturbation, given by $\sum_{i\neq g}{\int\frac{|\bra{\psi_g(r)}e\bm{E.r}\ket{\psi_g(r)}|^2}{E_g - E_i}d\bm{r}}$ is non-zero however, giving a to the ground state eigenfunction of:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_g(r)} \longrightarrow \ket{\psi_g(r)}\left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\eta_A E^2 \right)+...
\end{equation}

The strength of the hyperfine interaction, $A$, is given by the probability density of the electron wavefunction at the nucleus: $|\ket{\psi_g(r=0)}|^2$. 
Thus the change in the hyperfine is given by:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta A}{A} = \frac{|\ket{\psi_g(r=0, E\neq 0)}|^2}{|\ket{\psi_g(r=0, E = 0)}|^2} - 1 = \eta_AE^2 + O(E^4)
\end{equation}

giving a quadratic shift in $E$. $\eta_A$ gives the strength of the shift and is always negative - the mixing with the excited states always reduces the population at the nucleus and thus the hyperfine coupling with it. 
\\
In addition to the modulation of the hyperfine coupling there is an effect on the electron g-factor.
The g-factor is determined by the spin-orbit coupling and in general depends on the orientation of the applied magnetic field. 
Due to the valley symmetry of the silicon conduction band this anisotropy is normally averaged out but with the application of an electric field this symmetry is broken, changing the electron's orbit and thus its g-factor.
The strength of the effect depends on the axis of electric field. 
If this axis is along one of the valley axes ([100] crystal axis) then the effect is maximised.
If it is along the [111] crystal axis then the effect is equal for all valleys, leaving g-factor unchanged.
The g-factor change is given by:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta g_e}{g_e} - 1 = \eta_g(\theta_{BE}, \theta_{BC})E^2
\end{equation} 

where $\eta_g$ is the Stark g-factor parameter, $\theta_{BE}$ is the angle between magnetic and electric fields and $\theta_{BC}$ is the angle between the magnetic field and the crystal axis.
\\
Having discussed the theory and background of the Stark shift, I now turn to experimental progress on the subject.

\subsection{Stark Shift Measurement Techniques}

The first approach to measuring the Stark shift would be to take a field sweep.
A field sweep is a standard ESR procedure to determine the magnetic field at which a spin transition occurs for a given microwave frequency.
A standard Hahn echo sequence is performed and the intensity of the echo measured for a given before a new magnetic field is set and the procedure repeated.
At the correct magnetic field for a spin transition an echo will be recorded, with its intensity diminishing to 0 as the magnetic field moves off resonance.
A typical magnetic field sweep for phosphorus doped natural silicon is shown in figure \ref{fig:fieldSweep}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/fieldSweep.pdf}
\caption[Phosphorus field sweep]{Graph showing a standard field sweep to locate spin transitions for electrons bound to phosphorus donors in silicon. Hahn echo intensity is recorded for each magnetic field, with the two large peaks corresponding to electrons bound to the two different phosphorus nuclear spins: $\pm \frac{1}{2}$}
\label{fig:fieldSweep}
\end{figure} 

This experiment could be undertaken twice, once with electric field on and once with it off. 
The Stark shift would produce a change in spin transition frequency which would be observed as a shift in the peaks of the graph.
Unfortunately the Stark shift of the spin transition frequency is typically much smaller than the inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of the spin transition, meaning that no shift is visible \cite{Bradbury2007}. 
Instead Bradbury \emph{et al} used a more subtle technique, harnessing the ability of Hahn echo sequence to refocus inhomogeneous broadening. 
An electric pulse applied during only one half of a Hahn echo sequence would cause the spins to precess in the magnetic field at different rates when dephasing and rephasing. 
This shift can then be detected as a phase shift in the echo intensity from the real to the imaginary channel. 
Changing the length of the applied pulse and recording the echo intensity will introduce an oscillation. 
The frequency of this oscillation can then be determined using a Fourier transform, thereby giving the Stark shift.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/StarkShiftSequenceBasic.pdf}
\caption[Stark shift sequence]{The simplest sequence used to measure a Stark shift on an electron. As the pulse length is increased the electron ensemble acquires a different phase during the first half of the echo compared with the second half, seen as a phase shift in the echo from the real to the imaginary channel.}
\label{fig:starkseq}
\end{figure}
\\
A further effect that must be taken into consideration is the impact of local electric fields. 
These are present due to local deformations of the crystal lattice, creating different electric environments at each donor.
In the presence of an external electric field, the total Stark shift of a given donor is given by: 

\begin{equation}
\left (E_{\text{local}} + E_{\text{ext}} \right)^2 = E_{\text{local}}^2 + E_{\text{ext}}^2 + E_{\text{local}}E_{\text{ext}}
\end{equation}

The inhomogeneity of the local fields would usually provide a simple offset in the phase shift, but the term that is linear in both $E_{\text{local}}$ and $E_{\text{ext}}$ causes the inhomogeneity to get larger as the applied field gets larger.
This would result in a rapid decay of the echo signal, but can be avoided by applying a bipolar electric field pulse (i.e. half negative, half positive), a technique implemented by Bradbury \emph{et al} when measuring the Stark shift of antimony donors in silicon \cite{Bradbury2007}.
This cancels the linear term but has no impact on the quadratic term.
This sequence can be seen in figure \ref{fig:starkseq}. 

\subsection{Stark Shift Experimental Results}

Measurements of the Stark shift on all group V donors in silicon were undertaken by Wolfowicz \emph{et al} \cite{Wolfowicz2014,Pica2014}. 
The experiment was performed using bulk doped samples of silicon, placed between copper plates.
The copper plates were connected to an operational amplifier with an amplification factor of 126.
Pulses were generated using an arbitrary wave generator.
Results of their measurements are shown in figure \ref{fig:garyStarkResults}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Figures/starkShiftResultsGary.pdf}
\caption[Wolfowicz \emph{et al} Stark measurements]{These figures demonstrate the frequency shift in the spin transition as a result of the Stark shift, as measured by Wolfowicz \emph{et al} \cite{Wolfowicz2014}. Notable is the increased rate for higher nuclear spin numbers - this is due to the shift being proportional to the hyperfine coupling, which is in turn proportional to nuclear spin.}
\label{fig:garyStarkResults}
\end{figure}

These measurements determined the following Stark shift parameter for $\eta_A$, with $\eta_g$ being smaller than the measurement sensitivity:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c || c | c | c | c||}
\hline
& $^{31}$P & $^{75}$As & $^{121}$Sb & $^{209}$Bi \\
\hline
$\eta_A (\times 10^{-3} \mu m^2 / V^2)$ & $-2.5\pm 0.5$ & $-1.2 \pm 0.1$ & $-3.5 \pm 0.05$ & $-0.26\pm0.05$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Wolfowicz \emph{et al} also performed experiments to test conditional control of the spins using Stark shifts.
The aim of such an experiment is to shift the transition frequency of the selected spin by several times its linewidth.
This was not possible for the electron due to its broad linewidth even in purified silicon.
Instead the experiment was performed on the nuclear transition, which has a much narrower linewidth due to its smaller dipole moment.
By applying an electric field at the same time as nuclear spin $\pi$ pulse, Wolfowicz \emph{et al}, the process is measured as an identity with fidelity 93.3$\pm2.6\%$.
This indicates that it is possible to control the application of pulses to nuclear spin qubits using electric fields as required by the Kane proposal.
What is less clear is whether these spin qubits will be sufficiently resistant to any stray electric fields in a scalable quantum computing architecture. 

\subsection{The Nuclear Spin Bath in Natural Silicon}

% \subsection{Introduction}

The presence of $^{29}$Si nuclei in natural silicon has been discussed earlier as one of the chief factors impacting qubit coherence times in that medium.
Inhomogeneous hyperfine interactions between these spins and addressed electron spins leads to spectral diffusion and reductions in coherence times for qubits in natural silicon.
Although most proposals for silicon donor qubit architectures have involved purified silicon to avoid these issues, a proposal has been put forward to use these impurity spins as a quantum register with applications for error correction \cite{Wolfowicz2016a}.
From the perspective of the O'Gormann proposal, these spins could present a potential quantum register for data qubits, providing storage for their spin states during long computations.
In order to control the interaction between data qubits and the $^{29}$Si nuclear spins the Stark shift will be necessary to control the transition frequency of a given spin relative to an external control pulse.
Attempting to characterise the Stark shift of the hyperfine coupling between the electron and the $^{29}$Si nuclei will be a goal of this report.
